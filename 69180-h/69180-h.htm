<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE BODY OF A DAMNED PERSON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the month of June, 1703, and about
noontide on the last day of the week. The fair
in the market-place at Nîmes was therefore at
its height. A juggler was swallowing a sword
in the midst of an admiring circle. Mademoiselle
Héloïse, the <i>danseuse</i>, was walking the
tight-rope near at hand, and the pick-pockets
were plying their trade profitably on the outskirts
of the throng. There was a dancing
bear, and beyond him—a rival attraction—a
monkey in scarlet breeches, with a blouse or
camisole over them. The little creature’s antics
were hailed with shouts of derisive laughter and
cries of “Camisard!” “Barbet!” “Huguenot!”
the monkey’s little blouse being an unmistakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
caricature of the dress of the Camisards.
It therefore behooved the wise to laugh, and
they did, and that loudly,—though many a
heart was in secret sympathy with the Huguenot
rebels of the Cévennes; but were they not
in Nîmes? And the Intendant Bâville was
there, and the dragoons of King Louis XIV.;
so it was that the monkey gathered many a
half-crown, and sous and deniers in profusion,
in his little cap, and carried them—chattering—to
the showman. It was a motley throng:
broad, red-faced market-women, old crones
with bearded lip and toothless gums, little
gamins of the market with prematurely aged
faces, countrymen who glanced askance at the
monkey while they laughed, pretty peasant
girls who had sold their eggs and their poultry,
and come to spend their newly acquired riches
in ribbons and trinkets, and to have their fortunes
told by the old gypsy in the yellow
pavilion. Some strolling musicians were playing
a popular air, two drunken men were fighting,
and a busy tradesman was selling his wares
near the entrance of a tent that was manifestly
the centre of attraction. It was of white canvas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and decorated with numerous images of the
devil,—a black figure with horns, hoofs, and
tail, engaged in casting another person into
the flames; the whole being more startling than
artistic. At the door of this tent was a man
mounted on a barrel, and dressed fantastically
in black, with a repetition of the devils and
flames, in red and yellow, around the edge of
his long gown, which flapped about a pair of
thin legs, set squarely in the centre of two long,
schooner-shaped feet. This person, whose face
was gross and dull rather than malicious, kept
calling his invitation and bowing low as each
new visitor dropped a half-crown into the box
fastened on the front of the barrel beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>“Messieurs et mesdames!” he cried, “only
a half-crown to see the body of a damned
person!”</p>

<p>He raised his voice almost to a scream, to be
heard in the babel of tongues; he clapped his
hands to attract notice; he swayed to and fro
on his barrel.</p>

<p>“Here is the body of a damned person!” he
shouted. “<i>Dieu!</i> what an opportunity for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
good of your soul! Too much, madame?” he
said to a fishwife who grumbled at the price,
“too much! ’Tis a chance in a thousand!
The body came from the Tour de Constance!
Madame will have her money’s worth.”</p>

<p>Madame went in, licking her lips like a wolf.
The curtain of the tent swung to behind her.
A peasant lad followed her, hesitating too over
the half-crown, but then the spectacle was worth
money. A soldier followed, then a butcher,
and two stupid-looking servant-girls, with frightened
faces, but still eager to see. Then there
was a pause, and the showman began to shout
once more; he had need to, for the bear
was performing with unusual vivacity, and the
<i>danseuse</i> displayed her pretty legs as she
tripped on the rope.</p>

<p>“Half a crown, messieurs et mesdames,” cried
the man of the black robe; “half a crown to
see a dead and damned Huguenot!”</p>

<p>“Too much, monsieur!” said a voice behind
him.</p>

<p>He started and looked back into the face of
a little hunchbacked man who had been watching
him curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“You are not a good Catholic, M. le Bossu!”
replied the showman, mocking, for the hunchback
wore a poor suit of brown and a frayed
hat.</p>

<p>“I am a good Catholic,” he replied calmly,
“but your price is high—’tis only a dead
Huguenot.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i> but live ones are too plenty,” retorted
the other, with a loud laugh. “What
are you to complain?” he added gayly,—“the
hunchback!—<i>le bossu</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i>Le Bossu</i>—yes,” replied the hunchback,
calmly; “that is what men call me.”</p>

<p>Again the showman mocked him, doffing his
cap and grinning.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency’s name?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The hunchback took no notice of him; he
had his hand in his wallet feeling for a half-crown;
he had determined to see the damned
person. But the other got his answer; a little
gamin piped up on the edge of the crowd,
pointing his finger at the cripple.</p>

<p>“’Tis only Charlot,” he said, “the shoemaker
of the Rue St. Antoine.”</p>

<p>The showman laughed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Enter, Maître Savetier!” he said derisively,
“and see the dead Huguenot. <i>Dame!</i> but I
believe he is one himself,” he added, under his
breath, peering sharply at the pale face of le
Bossu as he entered the tent.</p>

<p>But a minute later the hunchback was forgotten
and the showman was screaming again.</p>

<p>“This way, mesdames! This way, to see
a damned person! Half a crown! half a
crown!”</p>

<p>Within, the tent was lighted solely by a small
aperture at the top, and the effect was rather of
a murky twilight than of broad noonday. It
was draped with cheap red cloth, and in the
centre—directly under the opening in the
top—was a rough bier constructed of bare
boards, and on this lay a body only partially
covered with a piece of coarse serge; images
of the devil—cut out of black stuff—were
sewed on the corners of this wretched pall.
The visitors, the sight-seers, who had paid
their half-crowns to enjoy this gruesome spectacle,
moved slowly past it, making the circuit
of the tent and finally passing out at the door
by which they had entered. When the hunchback<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
came in, he paused long enough to become
accustomed to the swift transition from
sunlight to shadow, and then he too proceeded
to join the circle around the corpse. There
were many comments made, the sight affected
the spectators differently. The two servant-girls
clung together, whispering hysterical
confidences; the peasant youth stared open-mouthed,
fright showing plainly in his eyes;
the soldier looked down with brutal indifference;
the old fishwife showed satisfaction, her wolf
mouth was slightly opened by a grin that displayed
three long yellow teeth—all she possessed;
a red handkerchief was tied around her
head and from below it hung her long gray
locks. Her short petticoat and bodice revealed
a withered, lean form, and her fingers were like
talons. She feasted her eyes on the dead face,
and then she squinted across the body at the
man who stood like a statue opposite. He
was young, with a sad, dark countenance and
was poorly, even shabbily dressed. But it was
none of these things that the old crone noted,
it was the expression of grief and horror that
seemed frozen on his features. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
see her, he did not see the others passing
by him—with more than one curious glance;
he seemed like a man in a trance, deaf,
blind, dumb, but yet gazing fixedly at the
inanimate figure on the bier. It was the
corpse of a young woman, who had been
handsome; the features were still so, and her
long black hair fell about her shoulders like a
mourning pall.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu!</i>” said the fishwife, licking her lips,
“what a white throat she had; ’twould have
been a pity to hang her. See, there is a mark
there on her arm where ’twas bound! Is she
not pretty, Bossu?”</p>

<p>The hunchback had approached the corpse,
and at this appeal he nodded his head.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” ejaculated the soldier turning on
the old crone, “’tis heresy to call a damned
person pretty, Mère Tigrane.”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane leered at him with horrible
intelligence.</p>

<p>“No one is to think a heretic pretty but the
dragoons, eh?” she said grinning. “<i>Dame!</i> we
know what you think, monsieur.”</p>

<p>The man laughed brutally, and she edged up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
to him, whispering in his ear, her narrow eyes
on the silent visitor opposite. The dragoon
looked over too at her words, and broke out
with an oath.</p>

<p>“You are a witch, Mère Tigrane,” he said
uneasily; “let me alone!”</p>

<p>Again she whispered, but laughed this time,
showing her yellow teeth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the showman had been fortunate
and a dozen new-comers crowded into the tent,
pressing the others aside. This afforded an
opportunity for the hunchback to approach the
young man, who had remained by the bier as if
chained to the ground. Le Bossu touched his
arm, at first lightly, but finding himself unheeded,
he jerked the other’s sleeve. The
stranger started and stared at him as if he
had just awakened from sleep.</p>

<p>“A word with you, friend,” said the hunchback,
softly.</p>

<p>The man hesitated, started, paused and cast
another long look at the dead face, and then
followed the cripple through the group at the
door, out into the sunshine and uproar of the
market-place. They were not unobserved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Mère Tigrane, but she made no effort to follow
them; she was watching the new arrivals as they
approached the corpse. As she saw their faces
of curiosity and horror, she laughed.</p>

<p>“<i>Mère de Dieu!</i>” she said, “’tis worth a
half-crown after all—and I paid Adolphe in
false coin too, <i>pauvre garçon</i>!”</p>

<p>In the market-place, the stranger had halted
with the hunchbacked cobbler.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded of le
Bossu; “I do not know you.”</p>

<p>“You were in danger,” replied the hunchback,
quietly, “and you are in trouble; the <i>bon Dieu</i>
knows that I also am in trouble.”</p>

<p>The little man’s tone, his deformity, his kind
eyes appealed to the other.</p>

<p>“We should be friends,” he said grimly.
“<i>Dieu!</i> I am indeed in trouble.”</p>

<p>The hunchback made a sign to him to be
cautious, the crowd hemmed them in, the monkey
chattered, the bear danced, Mademoiselle
Héloïse was singing a savory song from Paris.
The whole square was white with the sunshine;
above, the sky was deeply blue.</p>

<p>“Follow me, friend,” said le Bossu again, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
commenced to thread his way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>His new acquaintance hesitated a moment,
cast a backward glance at the tent he had just
quitted, and then quietly followed the hunchback.
They had to cross the market-place, and
the little cobbler seemed to be widely known.
Goodwives greeted him, young girls giggled
heartlessly before the misshapen figure passed,
men nodded indifferently, the maliciously disposed
children calling out “<i>le Bossu!</i>” at him as
he went. A heartless rabble out for a gala
day; what pity had they for the hunchbacked
shoemaker of the St. Antoine? The man who
followed him escaped notice; he was straight-limbed
and erect, and his shabby dress disguised
him as completely as any masquerade.
When they had left the crowd behind, they
walked together, but still silently, along the
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The groups of pleasure-seekers grew more
rare as they advanced, and they were almost
alone when they passed the Garden of the Récollets—the
Franciscan Convent—and entered
the Rue St. Antoine. Here it was that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
stranger roused himself and addressed his companion.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“To my shop,” replied le Bossu; “’tis but
ten yards ahead now. Have no fear,” he added
kindly; “the <i>bon Dieu</i> made me in such shape
that my heart is ever with the sorrowful.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you,” said the other.
“I do not know your name—you do not ask
mine—why do you seek me out?”</p>

<p>“My name is Charlot,” returned the cripple,
simply. “I make shoes, and they call me by
more than one name. My rich patrons say
Charlot, my poor ones call me <i>le Savetier</i>, others
mock me as the hunchback—<i>le Bossu</i>! It does
not matter. As for your name, I will know it
when you please, monsieur.”</p>

<p>They had come to an arched gateway between
two houses, and the cobbler entered, followed
by the other man. They stood in a
court, and on three sides of it were the faces of
three houses; it was a veritable <i>cul-de-sac</i>. A
small square of sunshine marked the centre of
the opening, and in this a solitary weed had
bloomed, springing up between the crevices in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the stone pavement. To the left was an arched
door with three steps leading to it, and over it
hung a sign with two shoes painted upon it.
The hunchback pointed at this.</p>

<p>“Behold my shop,” he said, “the sign of the
Two Shoes.”</p>

<p>He took a key out of his wallet, and ascending
the steps, opened the door and invited his
new acquaintance to enter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE SHOP OF TWO SHOES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two, le Bossu and his guest, entered a
small room fitted up as a shop. The window
was open and across the unused fireplace were
suspended half a dozen shoes of various sizes.
The cobbler’s bench was strewn with tools, and
scraps of leather lay on the floor. On one side
of the room hung a hide prepared for use; opposite
was a colored picture of St. Elizabeth,
with her arms full of roses, the patron saint of
the poor. There were two wooden chairs, the
cobbler’s stool, and a box of <i>sabots</i>, nothing
more. A door opened into the kitchen, where
a narrow flight of stairs—like a ladder—ascended
to the second story. On the kitchen
hearth the <i>pot-au-feu</i> was simmering, the savory
odor filling the room, and on the table
was a loaf of black bread and some garlic.</p>

<p>The hunchback asked his guest to be seated
and then sat down himself, looking attentively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
but kindly at the new arrival. The stranger
had a strong face, although he was still a young
man. His complexion was a clear olive, and
his dark eyes were gloomy and even stern.
He wore no periwig, his natural hair curling
slightly. In his turn, he scrutinized the cripple,
and never was there a greater contrast. Le
Bossu was small, and the hump on his back made
him stoop; as often occurs in such cases, the
upper part of his body and his head were out
of proportion with his small and shrunken limbs.
His arms were long and powerful, however, his
hands well shaped and strong, though brown
and callous from labor, and they were skilful
hands, able to earn a living despite the feeble
legs and back. His face was pale and drawn
from much physical suffering, but his eyes were
beautiful, large, brown, and full of expression.
They redeemed the cripple’s whole aspect, as
though the soul—looking out of its windows—made
its own appeal. It was his eye that won
upon his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“You said you wished to speak to me,” he
remarked abruptly. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you the truth, friend,” le Bossu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
replied calmly, “you were showing too much
emotion yonder; you were observed by the
dragoon and Mère Tigrane. She is a dangerous
person; men call her the she-wolf—<i>la
Louve</i>.”</p>

<p>“Too much emotion!” repeated the other.
“<i>Dieu!</i> you seem an honest man—shall I tell
you who that dead woman was?” he asked
recklessly. “Are you a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“I am,” replied the cobbler, quietly; “’tis
best to tell me nothing.”</p>

<p>His visitor stared at him.</p>

<p>“Why did you try to protect me, then?”
he asked. “I am a desperate man and unknown
to you—I have no money to reward
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Nor to pay for a lodging,” remarked the
hunchback.</p>

<p>The other thrust his hand into his pocket and
drew out half a crown, looking at it with a grim
smile.</p>

<p>“My worldly goods,” he said.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” rejoined the cobbler, dryly,
“and you paid the other half-crown to see the
dead Huguenot woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>An expression of pain passed over the face
opposite.</p>

<p>“I would have paid more to be sure that
it was—” He broke off, covering his face with
his hands. “Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i>” he exclaimed
brokenly.</p>

<p>The hunchback was silent for a few moments,
his arms folded and his eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>“You must leave Nîmes,” he said at last;
“you will betray yourself here. Meanwhile,
there is a room overhead; if you wish you can
stay there, free of rent, until you go.”</p>

<p>“Again, why do you do this?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>The cobbler indicated his hump with a gesture.</p>

<p>“The <i>bon Dieu</i> made me so,” he said simply;
“yet I am a scorn in the market-place, a
miserable cripple. I swore to the saints that
I would help the miserable.”</p>

<p>“You will take a risk,” remarked his companion,—“I
am François d’Aguesseau, a
Huguenot—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” The cobbler held up his hand. “I
do not wish to know, M. d’Aguesseau. If you
will take the upper room, ’tis yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“I will take it while I can pay for it, at least,”
said d’Aguesseau, “and I thank you.”</p>

<p>The hunchback rose, leading the way across
the kitchen to the stairs. He walked slowly,
and occasionally dragged one foot, but he
ascended the steps with some agility, followed
by his guest. There was a trap-door at the
top, which he opened before they could step
on to the floor above. D’Aguesseau knew that
he was taking a great risk, that this might be
a snare laid for those of the Religion, but he
was, at the moment, a desperate and reckless
man, and he cared little. He had entered
Nîmes that morning, almost without money,
he had just had his worst fears confirmed,
and he cared little now for life or death.</p>

<p>They entered a room above the kitchen,
where the cripple slept, and this opened into
another small room over the shop. Both were
clean, though poor and bare. The hunchback
stopped before a shrine in his own chamber,
and lighting a taper, set it before the Virgin.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked d’Aguesseau with a
strange glance from the image to the devotee.</p>

<p>“A prayer,” replied le Bossu; “when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
see danger I always offer a prayer to our
Lady.”</p>

<p>The Huguenot smiled contemptuously, but
said no more, following his host into the
front room.</p>

<p>“It is yours,” said the hunchback. “You are
weary; lie down until the <i>pot-au-feu</i> is ready,
and we will sup together.”</p>

<p>“I have been in many places,” said d’Aguesseau,
“and seen many people—but never one
like you before.”</p>

<p>Le Bossu smiled. “Yet—save for the hump—I
am as others,” he said quietly. “I hear
some one crossing the court,” he added; “if any
one enters the shop, ’tis best for you to be quiet
up here. There are some who need not know I
have a guest.”</p>

<p>“I trust I shall not imperil your safety by
any carelessness,” d’Aguesseau replied earnestly,
casting a kindly glance at the drawn face.</p>

<p>“I must go down,” said the cobbler. “Rest
here awhile; I will call you to supper.”</p>

<p>His guest thanked him, still much perplexed
by this unusual friendliness, and stood watching
the hunchback as he went back to the trap-door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and did not withdraw his eyes until his
host disappeared through the opening in the
floor.</p>

<p>Le Bossu heard footsteps in the shop as he
descended the stairs, and leaning forward, saw
Mère Tigrane in the kitchen door. Without a
word he went back and closed the trap, slipping
the bolt; then he came down to find la
Louve in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Where are my <i>sabots</i>, Petit Bossu?” she demanded,
her fierce little eyes travelling around
the room, and her lips very red. “I came for
them myself, you are so slow.”</p>

<p>“You do not need them, Mère Tigrane,” the
cobbler replied coolly, eying her feet; “your
<i>sabots</i> are as good as new. I did not promise
the others until St. Bartholomew’s day.”</p>

<p>She began to grumble, moving over to the
fire and peering into the <i>pot-au-feu</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i> but you live well, Charlot,” she remarked.
“The sight of the damned corpse
gave me also an appetite. <i>Mère de Dieu!</i> how
white and tender her flesh was! ’Twould have
made a good pottage,” she added laughing, her
yellow teeth showing against her blood-red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
tongue like the fangs of a she-wolf—verily, she
merited her name.</p>

<p>“You should arrange with Adolphe,” the
hunchback said coolly. “I will send you your
<i>sabots</i> on Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Eh! but I’ll come for them,” she replied
with a wink; “I love to come to visit
you.”</p>

<p>The cobbler grunted, moving slowly and painfully—as
he did at times—to the shop. But
Mère Tigrane was reluctant to follow him,—she
was listening; she thought she heard a
step overhead.</p>

<p>“Charlot,” she said amiably, “how much do
you get for your room above?”</p>

<p>“I do not rent it,” he replied calmly, but he
too was listening.</p>

<p>Happily, the sounds above ceased.</p>

<p>“I want it,” she remarked briskly; “I will pay
a good price for it—for my cousin. He is apprenticed
to the blacksmith behind the Garden
of the Récollets. I will look at it now—at
once—Petit Bossu.”</p>

<p>The cobbler started, but controlled himself,
though la Louve had her foot on the ladder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
She could be swift when she pleased, and she
could hobble.</p>

<p>“It is locked to-day,” he said coolly, “and I
shall not rent it now.”</p>

<p>She grinned, with an evil look.</p>

<p>“What have you got there, <i>mon chéri</i>?” she
demanded, shaking her cane at him with sinister
pleasantry.</p>

<p>“The devil,” replied le Bossu, sitting down to
his bench and taking up a shoe and beginning
to stitch.</p>

<p>“Or his wife—which?” la Louve asked
jocosely.</p>

<p>She was satisfied now that the trap was fastened,
and it was not always wise to offend the
cobbler. She returned to the shop with a dissatisfied
face.</p>

<p>“You have no hospitality,” she said, “you
dog of a cobbler—I will come on Wednesday
again for the <i>sabots</i>.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” he retorted indifferently,
stitching away.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i> you sew like a woman,” she remarked.
“You might better be cutting my
shoes out of the good wood, that does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
not split, than making those silly things of
leather!”</p>

<p>She lingered a little longer, but still he did not
heed her, and at last she hobbled off, picking
up a basket of fish that she had left on the
doorstep. But she did not leave the court
until she had looked again and again at the
upper window of the shop of Two Shoes. Yet
she saw nothing there but the white curtain
fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>An hour later she was back at the market-place,
grinning and selling her fish. She was
in time too, to hear the uproar when Adolphe,
the showman, found the false coin in his box.
She pushed to the fore, her red handkerchief
conspicuous in the group, and her sharp eyes
recognized the country boy who had followed
her in to see the damned person. The showman
was belching forth oaths and threats like
the fiery furnace that belched flames on
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Mère
Tigrane’s eyes gleamed, and she pointed a
long, bony finger at the poor lad.</p>

<p>“He put it in, Adolphe,” she shrieked, with
an oath. “I saw him, the vagabond!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Then she laughed and shook, clapping her
hands to her sides. It was so diverting—the
uproar, and the protests of the peasant boy
as he was dragged off to jail with the rabble
at his heels.</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i>” she said, “’twas worth a good half-crown.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>MADEMOISELLE’S SLIPPERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first day of the week Petit Bossu set his
house in order. He swept the floor of the
shop and put a cold dinner on the kitchen table
that his guest might eat in his absence. Then
he hung up his apron and blouse and, putting
on his worn brown coat, slipped the leather
strap of his wallet over his shoulder. Last he
took a pair of slippers out of a cupboard and
examined them with loving care and honest
pride in their workmanship. They were small,
high-heeled, blue slippers, daintily lined with
white silk, and with rosettes of blue ribbon on
the square toes. The little cobbler stroked
them tenderly, fastened one bow more securely,
and putting them carefully in his green bag,
set out on his journey. It was early, and few
people lounged in the streets, and le Bossu
passed unheeded through the Rue St. Antoine,
and went out at last at the Porte de France.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
His pace was always slow, and to-day he limped
a little, but he kept cheerfully on, turning his
face toward St. Césaire.</p>

<p>The highroad, white with dust, unrolled like a
ribbon through a rugged plain which lay southwest
of Nîmes, stretching from the low range
of limestone mountains—the foothills of the
Cévennes—on the north to the salt marshes
of the Mediterranean on the south. Rocks
cropped up on either side of the road; the
country was wild and barren-looking, although
here and there were fig trees and vineyards,
and farther west was the fertile valley of the
Vaunage. North of those limestone hills lay
the Cévennes, where since the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes the poor Huguenot peasants
were making their desperate fight for liberty
of conscience, against the might and the
bigotry of Louis XIV. Their leader, Laporte,
was dead, but he had been succeeded by Jean
Cavalier and Roland, and revolt still raged in
the caves and fastnesses of the upper Cévennes,
though Maréchal Montrevel and the Intendant
of Languedoc assured the king that they had
wiped out the insurrection. But the “Barbets”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
or “Camisards,” as they were called in derision,
though naming themselves “Enfants de Dieu,”
kept up the fierce death-struggle. Meanwhile
the city of Nîmes was judiciously orthodox in
the presence of the dragoons, and many
Huguenots went to mass rather than suffer
torture and death. Not every man is made for
a martyr, and there were terrors enough to
awe the most heroic. The bodies of Protestants
who died in prison were exposed at fairs
for a fee, or dragged through the streets on
hurdles to be burned, as a warning and example
to the misguided who still lived.</p>

<p>Yet the busy life of every day went on;
people bought and sold and got gain; others
married and made feasts; children were born,
to be snatched from Huguenot parents and
baptized into the old religion; some men died
and were buried, others were cast from the
galleys, at Marseilles, into the sea. Such was
life in Nîmes in those old days when the sign
of Two Shoes hung over the humble shop on
the Rue St. Antoine.</p>

<p>All this while le Bossu was trudging along
the white road. He met many country people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
now, bringing their vegetables and poultry to
town, and more than once he was saluted with
the mocking cry, “Petit Bossu!” He kept
steadily on, however, taking no heed, his face
pale from the exertion, or the repression of his
natural temper, which resented insults and injury
more keenly than most people of his condition,
in an age when the poor were as the beasts of
the field to the upper classes. Many thoughts
were passing in the hunchback’s mind, but he
dwelt most upon the little blue slippers, and
when he did, his brown eyes softened, the drawn
expression on his thin face relaxed.</p>

<p>“The <i>bon Dieu</i> bless her,” he murmured; “to
her I am not the hunchback or the cobbler—to
her I am poor Charlot, her humble friend.
<i>Ciel!</i> I would die for mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>He toiled slowly on; passing the village of St.
Césaire, he turned sharply to the north, and
walking through a grove of olive trees, came in
sight of a château that nestled on the crest of a
little eminence looking west toward the Vaunage.
The sun shone on its white walls and
sloping roof, and sparkled on its window panes.
The building was not large, and it had a long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
low wing at one side, the whole thrown into
sharp relief by its background of mulberry trees.
The house was partially closed, the wing showing
green-shuttered windows, but the main part
was evidently occupied. On the southern side
was the garden, with high hedges of box, and
toward this the cobbler turned his steps. As
he approached the wicket-gate, which was set
in a lofty part of the hedge, a dog began to bark
furiously, and a black poodle dashed toward
him as he entered, but recognizing the visitor,
she ceased barking and greeted le Bossu with
every demonstration of friendship.</p>

<p>“Ah, Truffe,” said the cobbler, gently, “where
is your mistress? I have brought her the blue
slippers at last.”</p>

<p>As if she understood the question, the poodle
turned and, wagging her tail, led the way back
between two rows of box toward the centre of
the garden. The dog and the cobbler came
out into an open circle well planted with rose
bushes, that grew in wild profusion around the
old sundial. Here were white roses and pink,
yellow and red, large and small; and sweet and
fragile they looked in the old garden, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
but poorly kept despite the neat hedges. On a
rustic seat in the midst of the flowers sat a
young girl, the sun shining on her fair hair, and
tingeing with brown the red and white of her
complexion. Her face and figure were charming,
and she had almost the air of a child, dressed
as she was in white, her flaxen hair falling in
two long braids over her shoulders.</p>

<p>The dog began to bark again at the sight of
her, running to her and back to the hunchback
to announce the arrival of a friend. She looked
up with a bright smile as the cobbler lifted his
cap and laid down the green bag on the seat at
her side.</p>

<p>“Ah, Charlot, you have my slippers at last,”
she exclaimed gayly, her blue eyes full of kindness
as she greeted her humble visitor.</p>

<p>“I have them, Mademoiselle Rosaline,” he
replied, his worn face lighting up, “and they are
almost worthy of the feet that will wear them.”</p>

<p>“Almost!” laughed mademoiselle, “you are
a born courtier, Charlot—oh, what dears!”</p>

<p>Le Bossu had opened his bag and drawn out
the blue slippers, holding them up for her
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“They are pretty enough for a queen!” said
Rosaline, taking them in her hands and looking
at them critically, with her head on one side.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlot, I shall never forgive you if
they do not fit!”</p>

<p>“They will fit like gloves, mademoiselle,”
the shoemaker replied complacently; “let me
try them on for you.”</p>

<p>But she was not yet done with her examination.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the pattern for the
rosettes?” she asked eagerly; “truly, they are
the prettiest I have seen.”</p>

<p>“I copied them after a pair from Paris,
mademoiselle,” he replied, as pleased as she at
his own success. “The heels too are just like
those worn at Versailles.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Rosaline laughed softly.</p>

<p>“I told you that you were a courtier, Charlot,”
she said; “but they say that the king wears
high red heels, because he is not tall.”</p>

<p>“But red heels would not please mademoiselle
on blue shoes,” remarked the hunchback,
smiling.</p>

<p>“But, Charlot,” said she, with a mischievous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
gleam of fun in her eyes, “if we must all be of
the king’s religion, must we not all also wear
his red heels?”</p>

<p>The cobbler’s pale face grew sad again.</p>

<p>“Alas, mademoiselle,” he said, with a sigh,
“to you ’tis a jest, but to some—” he shook
his head gravely, looking down at the little
blue slippers in her lap.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she asked quickly, the
smile dying on her lips. “Have they—been
burning any one lately in Nîmes?”</p>

<p>“Nay, mademoiselle,” he replied, kneeling on
one knee in the gravel path, and taking the slippers
off her small feet to try on the new ones.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Charlot—tell me,” persisted
his patroness, scarcely heeding the shoe that
he was drawing on her right foot. “You are
as solemn as an owl this morning.”</p>

<p>“I will tell mademoiselle,” he rejoined, reverently
arranging the rosette and smoothing the
white silk stocking around the slender ankle.
“Then she must not blame me if she is horrified.”</p>

<p>“She is often horrified,” interrupted Rosaline,
with a soft little laugh. “Go on, Charlot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“There was a fair on Saturday—mademoiselle
knows, for I saw Babet there buying a silk
handkerchief—”</p>

<p>“Babet cannot stay away from a fair for her
life,” mademoiselle interpolated again.</p>

<p>“’Twas a very fine fair,” continued le Bossu,
putting on the other slipper. “There were
many attractions, and the jailer—Zénon—had
the body of a damned woman there; Adolphe,
the showman, exhibited it for half a crown.
She, the dead woman, was, they say, one of
the Huguenot prisoners from the Tour de Constance,
and she died on her way here; she was
to be examined by M. de Bâville for some
reason,—what, I know not,—but she died
on the road, and Zénon made much by the
exhibition.”</p>

<p>Rosaline shuddered, the color fading from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“And you went to see that horrible, wicked
spectacle, Charlot?” she demanded, in open
disgust.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle knows I am a good Catholic,”
replied the cobbler, meekly, his eyes drooping
before her look of disdain. “’Tis done for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the good of our souls—to show us the fate
of these misguided people.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” ejaculated mademoiselle, softly.</p>

<p>Silence fell between them unbroken save by
the soft sounds of summer, the humming of the
honey-bees, the murmur of the mulberry leaves
stirred by a light wind. Mademoiselle sat looking
vacantly at her new slippers, while the shoemaker
still knelt on one knee watching her face
with that pathetic expression in his eyes that
we see only in the look of sufferers.</p>

<p>“That was not all I saw at the fair,” he went
on at last. “In the tent there was also—”</p>

<p>Rosaline made a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>“I will hear no more!” she cried indignantly.</p>

<p>“This will not horrify you, mademoiselle,” he
replied gently; “’tis only the story of my new
guest.”</p>

<p>Her face relaxed, partly because she saw that
she had hurt the hunchback’s feelings.</p>

<p>“Well, you may tell me,” she said reluctantly.</p>

<p>“There was a young man there—in that
tent— Nay, mademoiselle, I will say nothing
more of it.” Le Bossu broke off, and then went
on carefully: “He was in great anguish, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
I saw that he was watched by a wicked old
woman and one of the dragoons. I got him
away to my house, and there I found he had
no money, except one piece, and was in great
trouble. He is—” the cobbler looked about
keenly at the hedges, then he lowered his voice,
“a Huguenot.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do with him?” Rosaline
demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>“He is in my upper room now,” replied the
hunchback, “but I do not know where he will
go. He is not safe in Nîmes. I think he wants
to join the Barbets, but, of course, he tells
me nothing. He is a gentleman, mademoiselle,
le Bossu knows, and very poor, like many of
the Huguenots, and proud. I know no more,
except that he was reckless enough to tell
me his name.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, all interest now, and
more than ever forgetful of her new slippers.</p>

<p>“François d’Aguesseau,” he answered, in an
undertone, with another cautious glance behind
him.</p>

<p>“’Tis all very strange,” remarked mademoiselle,
regarding the worn face thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
“You are a good Catholic, Charlot, yet you
imperil yourself to shelter a Huguenot.”</p>

<p>“The risk to me is very little,” he replied
with great simplicity. “I am too humble for
M. de Bâville, and how could I give him up?
He is a kind young man, and in trouble; ah,
mademoiselle, I also have had troubles. May
the <i>bon Dieu</i> forgive me if I do wrong.”</p>

<p>“I do not think you do wrong, Charlot,” she
said gently, “and I am sure the <i>bon Dieu</i> forgives
you; but M. de Bâville will not.”</p>

<p>“I can die but once, mademoiselle,” he
rejoined smiling.</p>

<p>“Why is it you always smile at death?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle, you are not as I am,” he
said quietly. “Death to me—the gates of
Paradise stand open—suffering over—poverty
no more!”</p>

<p>Tears gathered in Rosaline’s blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you suffer much now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nearly always,” he replied.</p>

<p>Again there was a painful silence. Then le
Bossu recollected the slippers and rearranged
the rosettes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“They fit like gloves, mademoiselle,” he said
calmly, “do they give you comfort?”</p>

<p>The girl roused herself.</p>

<p>“They are beautiful, Charlot,” she replied,
standing up and pacing to and fro before the
bench, to try them. “They do not even feel
like new shoes. You are a magician.”</p>

<p>She had lifted her white skirts to show the
two little blue feet. Le Bossu stood up too,
admiring not only the slippers, but the beautiful
face and the golden hair, as fair as the sunshine.
Even Truffe, the poodle, danced about
in open approval. Then they heard a sharp
voice from the direction of the house.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle Rosaline!” it
called; “the dinner grows cold, and Madame
de St. Cyr is waiting. <i>Viens donc!</i>”</p>

<p>“Poor Babet!” laughed Rosaline; “I am her
torment. Come to the house, Charlot; she will
have a dinner for you also, and grandmother
will be delighted with these beautiful slippers.
Come, Truffe, you at least are hungry, you
little <i>gourmande</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>ROSALINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun shone cheerfully in the dining room
of the château. The long windows were open,
and the soft June air came in, laden with the
sweetness of the garden. The room was of
moderate size and furnished with perfect simplicity,
the polished dark wood floor being bare
of rugs. In the corner was a tall clock with a
silver dial, wherein were set the sun, moon, and
stars, moving in unison with the hands. On the
sideboard were a few pieces of silver that dated
back to the days of Francis I. The table, covered
with a fair linen cloth, was set for two, a
glass bowl full of pansies in the centre. Rosaline
sat at one end and at the other was her
grandmother, Madame de St. Cyr. Between
them was Truffe, the poodle, sitting solemnly,
with a napkin tied about her neck, and turning
her black face from one to the other in eager
but subdued anticipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Madame de St. Cyr was an old gentlewoman
with a handsome, delicate face and the blue
eyes of her granddaughter; her hair had the
whiteness of snow and there were lines of age
and suffering about her mouth. She wore a
plain gown of black silk with a fall of lace at
the throat, and a lace cap on her head, and her
thin white hands showed the blue veins like
whip-cords, but they were slender and graceful
hands, with tapering fingers and delicate wrists.</p>

<p>The two women were alone; their only servant,
the woman Babet, was in the kitchen, setting
out a dinner for the cobbler, and they
could hear the murmur of her voice as she lectured
him. Madame de St. Cyr was listening
to Rosaline with a troubled face.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>grand’mère</i>, can we not help him?” the
girl said earnestly. “Think of his desolate situation.”</p>

<p>“We are poor, Rosaline,” the old woman replied
gently, “and helpless. Moreover, if our
religion were suspected the <i>bon Dieu</i> only knows
what would happen. I am too old to hide away
in the caves of the Cévennes! Nor is it clear
that it is my duty to help this fellow religionist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
if by so doing I put you in danger. Ah,
my child, for you it would be the Tour de Constance—or
worse!”</p>

<p>Rosaline was feeding some morsels to Truffe
with perfect composure.</p>

<p>“I have never been afraid, <i>grand’mère</i>,” she
said, “and I hate to live a lie—but I know you
are wise. Yet, oh, madame, think of this Huguenot
in Nîmes!”</p>

<p>“What did Charlot call him?” her grandmother
asked thoughtfully. “I thought the
name was familiar.”</p>

<p>“He said ’twas François d’Aguesseau.”</p>

<p>Madame de St. Cyr sat a moment silent, trying
to gather her recollections in shape, then
her memory suddenly helped her.</p>

<p>“Certainly I know,” she said; “they are from
Dauphiné. He must be the son of Sieur
d’Aguesseau who was broken on the wheel at
Montpellier in ’99. I remember now very well;
he had a son and a daughter, and I did hear
that she was carried away to the Tour de Constance.
It must have been the same young
woman whose corpse was exhibited on Saturday
at Nîmes. The song is true,” she added sadly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“&#160;‘Nos filles dans les monastères,</div>
<div class="indent">Nos prisonniers dans les cachots,</div>
<div class="verse">Nos martyrs dont le sang se répand à grands flots,</div>
<div class="indent">Nos confesseurs sur les galères,</div>
<div class="indent">Nos malades persécutés,</div>
<div class="verse">Nos mourants exposés à plus d’une furie,</div>
<div class="indent">Nos morts traînés à la voierie,</div>
<div class="indent">Te disent (ô Dieu!) nos calamités.’&#160;”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“What a terrible story of sorrow it is!” remarked
Rosaline; “and to think that the corpse
of a gentlewoman should be exposed in the
market-place! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I wonder if mine
will be!”</p>

<p>Madame put up her hand with a gesture of
horror.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said, with white lips, “I cannot
bear it.”</p>

<p>Rosaline was contrite in a moment.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, <i>grand’mère</i>,” she said
sweetly; “you and I have lived so long the life
of concealed Huguenots, treading on the edge
of the volcano, that I grow careless in speech.”</p>

<p>“But do you not see why I am so reluctant
to take a risk?” her grandmother asked. “Yet
I know that this François d’Aguesseau is related
to me through his mother. I remember now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
who she was, and it seems that I must do what
I can.”</p>

<p>Her granddaughter’s face lighted. “That is
like you, madame,” she said brightly; “we
could not believe she would turn a deaf ear,
could we, Truffe? Ah, you <i>petite gourmande</i>,
have I not given you enough?”</p>

<p>The older woman watched the girl fondly as
she fed and petted the dog. This granddaughter
was her last link with the world. Her son,
the Comte de St. Cyr had fallen fighting for
the king the year before the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, when Rosaline was only three
months old. His wife survived him only two
years, and the grandmother brought up the
child. They had never been rich, and the estate
had suffered under madame’s management, for
she was always cheated and robbed, being as
unworldly as a woman could be who had seen
something of the gay life of her day. Her
mind now was full of the guest of le Bossu,
and she was troubled.</p>

<p>“I do not know what we can do, Rosaline,”
she said in evident perplexity; “he can come
here, of course, and share our crust, if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
will, but a guest, and an unknown one, would
excite comment; and there is M. de Baudri.”</p>

<p>Rosaline made a grimace. “I wish M. de
Baudri would stay with his dragoons in Nîmes,”
she retorted. “But, <i>grand’mère</i>, there must be
a way. Let us think and think, until we find it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand Charlot,” remarked
Madame, meditatively. “We know he is a devout
Romanist, yet this is not the first time
I have known him to help the persecuted.”</p>

<p>“He is the strangest little man in the world,”
replied Rosaline, “and I believe that his heart
is as big as his poor misshapen body. He is
strangely refined too, for his condition in life.
Poor little Charlot!”</p>

<p>“Do you think he suspects our religion?”
madame asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” her granddaughter replied
slowly, “but sometimes I think so.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” murmured the old woman, with
a sigh; “the axe hangs over our heads.”</p>

<p>Rosaline looked up surprised.</p>

<p>“Surely you do not fear Charlot?” she exclaimed.
“Charlot!—why, he would no more
betray us than would old Babet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Babet is of the Religion; I trust no one
else,” returned Madame de St. Cyr, gravely.</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Rosaline calmly; “I trust
Charlot and Père Ambroise.”</p>

<p>“In a way, we are in Père Ambroise’s hands,”
her grandmother replied, “and I do not believe
he would betray you; he means instead to
convert you. As for me, I am too near death
to trouble him.”</p>

<p>“You do him an injustice,” retorted Rosaline;
and then she smiled. “The good father is
naturally kind,—he cannot help it; he is so
round and sleek that he rolls through the world
as easily as a ball. To strike anything violently
would make him bounce uncomfortably, so dear
old Père Ambroise rolls blandly on. I should
weep indeed if the naughty Camisards caught
the kind soul and harmed him. I can see him,
though, trying to run away, with his round eyes
starting and his fat cheeks quivering like Babet’s
moulds of jelly; and how short his breath would
come! <i>Mon père</i> is my friend, so do not find
fault with him, <i>grand’mère</i>, even when he tries
to convert me,—pretending all the while that
he believes me to be one of his flock!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Madame de St. Cyr laughed a little at the
picture the girl drew of Père Ambroise, but the
laugh died in a sigh. She had all the misgivings,
the faint-heartedness of age, while Rosaline
was as full of life and spirits as a child, and
as thoughtless of the dreadful fate that might
any day overtake her. She laughed now and
told Truffe to beg for a tart, and then scolded
the poodle for eating sweets, all the while making
a picture of youthful loveliness that made
the old room bright with hope and joy. The
finger of fate had not yet been laid on Rosaline’s
heart; she knew neither love nor fear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE COBBLER’S GUEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the upper room of the shop of Two Shoes
sat a desperate man. The sun did not shine
for François d’Aguesseau, and in the little court
off the Rue St. Antoine there were no honey-bees
to fill the June air with their cheerful hum,
and no flowers except the blooming weed that
had sprung up between the flagstones. The
good woman in the house opposite had a couple
of children, who were playing on her doorstep;
the sign of the Two Shoes squeaked a little as
it swung in the gentle breeze; these were the
only sounds, though the busy life of Nîmes was
flowing through the thoroughfare at the mouth
of the court. But the Huguenot considered
none of these things. He sat alone in the cobbler’s
house, his elbows leaning on the table
before him, his head on his hands. His body
was in Nîmes, but his soul was away in Dauphiné.
When he closed his eyes he saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
valley of the Durance and the old town of
Embrun, where his childish feet had made so
many journeys that he might look up in wonder
at the Tour Brune or rest in the parvis of the
Cathedral,—for his family had not always been
Protestants. Then he saw in his vision the
château near Embrun where he was born, and
the terrace where he and his sister Hélène had
played together,—the same Hélène whose body
lay exposed at the bazar on Saturday. She
was only a woman, but she had died for her
religion and he had escaped; through no fault
of his, though, for he had been reckless enough
of life in his efforts to rescue her. He had
tried to move heaven and earth for her, and
had not even obtained a hearing in Paris.
Fate, the inexorable, had closed every avenue
of mercy; the young and innocent woman had
languished in the pestilential atmosphere of the
Tour de Constance, had died at last to be subjected
to degradation after death by her unmerciful
jailers. It was over at last, her body
had been publicly burned, and there remained
no longer any reason for him to linger in Nîmes.
His mother, dying of a broken heart over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
fates of husband and daughter, had made
him solemnly promise to leave France forever.
In England he would find relatives, and there
too his father had wisely invested a small sum
of money against the evil day when they
might have to quit Dauphiné. Therefore
François was not quite penniless, though the
State had comfortably seized all his lands and
his goods. But he was, at the moment, without
money or means of communicating with his
English friends. The Huguenots were closely
watched, and it was no light thing to escape.
Moreover, he longed to strike a blow for his religion,
for liberty, before he left his native land.
His promise bound him, yet could he not linger
long enough to serve the cause in some way?
A strange fascination held him in Nîmes where
he had suffered so much; not only did he lack
money to pay his way to the sea-coast, but he
lacked also the desire to go. Languedoc had
been fatal to two of his family, yet he lingered,
casting his eyes toward the Cévennes. Ah, to
strike a good blow to revenge his father and
sister! He was no saint, and in the upper
room over the shop he ground his teeth in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
rage and despair. <i>Dieu!</i> had he not seen the
body of his innocent sister exhibited for half
a crown? the body of his father broken on the
wheel at Montpellier? He thought with grim
satisfaction of the terrible death of the archpriest
Du Chayla at Pont-de-Montvert in ’72.
The enraged peasantry of the surrounding
country, having endured terrible persecutions at
the hands of the archpriest, rose and attacking
his house in the night slew him with fifty-two
blows. D’Aguesseau recalled the circumstance
now and thought of de Bâville the Intendant of
Languedoc, and of Montrevel, who was directing
the army in its efforts to crush the Camisards.
But the young Huguenot did not come of the
blood of assassins. Doubtless, it would be a
service to his religion to strike down either of
these men, and die for it afterwards, but he was
not made to creep upon a victim in the dark or
lie in wait for him at some unexpected moment.
He could join Cavalier or Roland, but he could
not do the murderer’s work in Nîmes, though
his soul was darkened by his afflictions.</p>

<p>He reflected, too, on the kindness of the shoemaker.
He had recklessly placed himself at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the hunchback’s mercy, yet no advantage had
been taken of his admission. It was a crime to
conceal or shelter a Huguenot, yet the humble
little cobbler showed no fear, but courageously
offered his friendship to a proscribed criminal,—for
it was criminal to be of any religion except
the king’s. The charity of the poor cripple
softened d’Aguesseau’s heart; he suppressed his
sneer when he saw the taper burning in front of
the Virgin. It was Romish idolatry, he said to
himself, but the idolater was also a Christian.
Nor would he be a charge upon the kind shoemaker;
he had been now two nights and nearly
two days his guest, and he must relieve him of
such a burden. He could repay him if he ever
reached England, but he cared little whether he
reached it or not. His enforced idleness, too,
wrought upon him; he was a strong, active
man, and he could not endure this sitting still
and waiting an opportunity. He had been
brought up for the army, but no Huguenots
were wanted in the army, and he had not the
instinct of a merchant. He intended to go to
England or Holland and enter the service of
one State or the other. But first—while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was waiting for the chance to quit the country—why
not go into the Cévennes? The temptation
was upon him and he well-nigh forgot his
pledge to quit France.</p>

<p>As the afternoon advanced, he left the little
room over the shop and descended into the
kitchen. He did not eat the dinner that le
Bossu had set out for him; he had gone fasting
too often of late to feel the loss of regular meals,
and he could not eat with relish food for which he
could not pay. He went out through the shop,
creating no little excitement in the neighboring
houses as he crossed the court and entered
the Rue St. Antoine. He had been closely
housed since Saturday, and freedom was sweet.
He stood a moment looking about at the groups
of chattering townspeople, and then he turned
his steps toward the Garden of the Récollets.
It was nearly five o’clock and the shadows were
lengthening on the west side of the streets, and
he heard the church bells ringing as though
there were peace and good-will on earth. A
rag-picker was at work at the mouth of an alley,
some dirty children were playing in the kennel,
and a boy with a basket of figs on his head was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
crying the price as he went along. It was an
ordinary street scene, busy and noisy, and
d’Aguesseau brushed against a Jesuit priest as
he walked on past the Cathedral of St. Castor.</p>

<p>Full of his own gloomy thoughts he went from
street to street, and was only aroused at last by
finding himself nearly opposite a tavern—which
bore the sign of the Golden Cup—and
in the midst of an uproar. The doors and windows
of the public house were crowded, and
a rabble came up the street with jeers and cries
and laughter. D’Aguesseau drew back into the
shelter of a friendly doorway and waited the approach
of the <i>canaille</i>, and it was not long before
the excitement was explained. The street was
not very wide, and the crowds seemed to choke
it up as they advanced; and a little ahead of the
rabble came a chain of prisoners driven along
by the whips of their guards and pelted with
stones and offal by the spectators. The criminals
were fastened in pairs by short chains,
each having a ring in the centre; then a
long heavy chain was passed through these
rings, thus securing the pairs in a long double
column. There were fifty men thus fastened;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
twenty-five on one side, and twenty-five on the
other, and between, the cruel iron chain; each
man bearing a weight of a hundred and fifty
pounds, though they were of all ages and conditions,
from the beardless boy to the veteran
bowed with years. It was a gang going to the
galleys at Marseilles, and there were thieves,
murderers, and Huguenots; the latter especially
and fatally distinguished by red-jackets that
they might be the mark of every stone and every
insult of the bystanders. Like the exposure
of the corpses of damned persons, the chain was
a moral lesson for the people, and especially for
the recalcitrants.</p>

<p>As the unfortunates approached, women
leaned from the windows to cry out at them,
and even the children cast mud and stones.
D’Aguesseau looked on sternly; he did not
know how soon he might be of that number,
and he counted forty-two red-jackets. The
leaders came on stubbornly; they were two
strong men of middle age, and they bore the
chain with grim fortitude, but the two who
followed were pitiful enough,—a white-haired
man, who limped painfully and was near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
end of his journey, and a boy with a red streak
on each cheek, and the rasping cough of a consumptive.
The next pair were also red-jackets;
both were lame. The fourth couple walked
better; the fifth had to be lashed up by the
guards. They were hailed with laughter and
derision; the convicts received sympathy, the
Huguenots were pelted so vigorously that the
blood flowed from more than one wound, as
the keepers whipped them into the stable-yard
of the Golden Cup, with the rabble at their
heels. The chain would be fastened in the
stable, while the guards took some refreshments,
and here was an opportunity, therefore, for
the population to enjoy some innocent diversion.
A Huguenot prisoner and a dancing
bear served much the same purpose. The
street was nearly cleared, so many crowded
into the inn-yard, and the sounds of merriment
rose from within.</p>

<p>D’Aguesseau was turning away in stern disgust,
when he came face to face with a hideous
old woman, with a string of fish in her hand.
She had been gloating over the chain, and she
was smiling amiably still, running her very red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
tongue along the edge of her red lips. She
curtsied to François and held out her fish.</p>

<p>“A bargain, monsieur,” she said pleasantly.
“The sight of the red-jackets makes Mère
Tigrane feel good; the fish are cheap.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, making an effort to pass
her, but she persisted.</p>

<p>“One fish, monsieur,” she protested,—“a
mountain trout. <i>Dame!</i> ’tis fresh, caught this
morning. The spectacle of these Huguenots
has made monsieur hungry.”</p>

<p>“My good woman, I want neither fish nor
fowl,” d’Aguesseau said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Monsieur makes a mistake,” she persisted
with a grin; “these are good fish, caught in the
stream where they drowned a Camisard witch
last week!”</p>

<p>With a suppressed exclamation he thrust
her aside and walked on, her shrill laughter in
his ears, and the cries of the rabble in the yard
of the Golden Cup. As for Mère Tigrane, she
stood a moment looking longingly at the inn;
could she forego the diversion? Finally, she
decided between two attractions, and quietly
followed D’Aguesseau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>The next day, when François descended from
his room, he heard voices in the shop, and saw
that the cobbler was talking to two women.
One was tall, raw-boned, and grim-faced, with
iron-gray hair and keen black eyes, and wore
the dress of an upper servant; the other was
one of the most charming young girls he had
ever seen. He stood in the kitchen undecided
whether to retire or to quietly admire the
picture, but before he could determine upon
his proper course le Bossu called him.</p>

<p>“Come in, monsieur,” he said; “Mademoiselle
de St. Cyr would speak to you.”</p>

<p>François responded with some surprise, and
bowed in reply to Rosaline’s curtsey.</p>

<p>“M. d’Aguesseau,” she said, blushing a little
under his glance, “my <i>grand’mère</i>, Madame de
St. Cyr desires to see you, being acquainted
with your family,—she knew your mother.”</p>

<p>His eyes lighted with surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>“Madame de St. Cyr does me much honor to
request a visit, mademoiselle,” he replied; “I
am at her service.”</p>

<p>Rosaline and Babet had been into Nîmes to
shop, and they were ready to go. The young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
girl laid her hand on the older woman’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Then we will expect you to-morrow afternoon,
monsieur,” she said quietly; “my very
good friend Charlot will direct you to St. Cyr,
and madame my <i>grand’mère</i> will be pleased to
make you welcome.”</p>

<p>M. d’Aguesseau murmured his acknowledgments,
while he aided Babet in gathering up
numerous small packages, and then the two
women bade Charlot <i>adieu</i> and departed,—the
drawn face of the cobbler clouding as Rosaline
left, as though the sun were obscured. The
younger man turned from the door with an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Who is that angel?” he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Le Bossu was stitching a shoe, his fingers
shaking a little as he thrust the needle into the
stubborn leather.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Rosaline de St. Cyr,” he replied
quietly, his brown eyes searching his guest
with a new sternness. “You had better retire,
monsieur, there comes one of the Franciscan
fathers for his shoes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A MILITARY SUITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> had passed and the afternoon sun
was shining red on the windows of St. Cyr, while
the shadows lengthened in the rambling old
garden. Rosaline was feeding her doves beside
the sundial, Truffe sitting on the rustic bench
in disgrace because she had made a dash at the
feathered pets who came cooing to the young
girl’s feet. It was a picture that the sunshine
touched with tender radiance; behind was the
dark green hedge, the blooming roses, and in
the circle by the dial the doves were flocking to
take food from their mistress, whose fair face
was as softly colored as the roses, and her hair
showing its loveliest tints of gold. She talked
to her pets while she fed them.</p>

<p>“There, there! Marguerite, you have had
more than your share; you are as great a <i>gourmande</i>
as the naughty Truffe,” she said, shaking
her finger at one pretty bird. “<i>Viens donc</i>, my
Condé! Here is a crumb for you, sweetheart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
As for Mademoiselle d’Hautefort, she shall have
nothing if she pushes so against Corneille.
What a lot of little rogues!”</p>

<p>She had distributed all her crumbs and the
doves were fluttering over them, struggling for
the largest fragments, and even alighting on her
wrists and hands in their eagerness. Truffe
meanwhile sulked under her punishment, her
bright black eyes watching the birds with malicious
longing for vengeance.</p>

<p>“You pretty creatures, how I love you!” said
Rosaline, caressing the two doves she had gathered
into her arms. “Look at them, Truffe,
and be ashamed of your evil thoughts. Nay,
do not deny them, madame; can I not read your
eyes? You would eat them, you wicked ogress,
I see it! Ah, there—you are raising your ears;
what is it, <i>ma chérie</i>?”</p>

<p>The dog not only pointed her ears, she began
to bark, looking back toward the house, but not
daring to spring from the seat where she had
been ordered to remain until pardoned.</p>

<p>“You hear a step on the gravel, Truffe, and
so do I,” said Rosaline listening. “Maybe it is
the—new steward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Truffe barked again and then uttered a low
growl of displeasure as a man turned the corner
of the hedge and came into view. He was
moderately tall, with a handsome figure, which
was arrayed in the height of fashion; his coat of
uncut velvet was laced with gold, and he wore
red heels on his high riding-boots, and his waistcoat
and trousers were of satin. His full, curled
periwig was fresh from Paris like the little hat,
which was covered with feathers. He made
Mademoiselle de St. Cyr a wonderful bow and
then looked at her in open admiration, his blue
eyes sparkling and his white teeth showing as
he smiled.</p>

<p>“A dove in the midst of doves,” he said with
gallantry; “mademoiselle is ever the fairest rose
in her garden.”</p>

<p>“M. de Baudri makes very pretty compliments,”
Rosaline replied, her smiling composure
unruffled. “Truffe and I did not know he
had honored St. Cyr with a visit.”</p>

<p>“I have been half an hour with madame,” he
replied, “all the while hoping to catch a glimpse
of the loveliest face in the world.”</p>

<p>“I would have sent Truffe, if I had known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that you desired to see her, monsieur,” Rosaline
replied demurely.</p>

<p>Monsieur bit his lip; he hated dogs and the
provoking little witch knew it.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle chooses to mock me,” he said,
“and mockery comes unnaturally from such
lovely lips.”</p>

<p>Rosaline laughed softly, still caressing a dove
that nestled on her arm.</p>

<p>“Tell me the news from Nîmes, monsieur,”
she retorted lightly; “I love a good story, you
know.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, mademoiselle, if you will
love the story teller,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I cannot judge until I have heard the
story,” she retorted, mischievous mirth in her
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“There is not so much to tell, mademoiselle,”
he said; “these wretches—the Camisards—still
trouble us despite their defeat at Vagnas.
If we could get the head of the brigand Cavalier
all would be well. Has mademoiselle heard
of M. le Maréchal’s dinner party? ’Tis amusing
enough. M. Montrevel is in a bad humor;
the villain Cavalier has cut up two detachments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
as you know,—one at Ners, and one intended
for Sommières. Thinking of these things and
drinking wine—after dinner—M. le Maréchal
was angry, and at the moment came tidings
that these heretics were praying and howling
in a mill on the canal, outside of the Porte-des-Carmes.
<i>Mère de Dieu!</i> you should have seen
Montrevel. In a trice he had out a regiment
of foot, and away he went to the mill. The
soldiers surrounded it and broke open the door,
and there sure enough were a lot of psalm-singers,
about three hundred old men, women,
and children—heretics all! The soldiers went
in—ah, mademoiselle does not desire particulars;
but truly it is slow work to cut three
hundred throats, especially in such confusion.
M. le Maréchal ordered them to fire the mill.
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> ’twas a scene! It burned artistically,
and the soldiers drove back all who tried
to escape. One rogue, M. Montrevel’s own servant too,
saved a girl, but the maréchal ordered
them both hung at once. He was begged off
by some sisters of mercy, who unhappily came
by just as they had the noose over his head, but
the heretic had been hung already. ’Tis called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
M. Montrevel’s dinner party in Nîmes; and there
is a saying that one must burn three hundred
heretics before M. le Maréchal has an appetite.”</p>

<p>Rosaline stood stroking the dove, her eyes
averted.</p>

<p>“What a pleasant story, monsieur,” she remarked
coldly, “to tell out here in the warm
sunshine! What do I want to know of those
wretches dying in the flames?” and she flashed
a sudden look of scorn upon him that brought a
flush to his face.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle should have asked me to
tell her the one story that I know by heart,”
he replied, his voice and manner changing
in an instant and full now of courtesy and
propitiation.</p>

<p>“And what is that, monsieur?” she asked
shortly; the color was warm in her cheeks and
her blue eyes flashed dangerously.</p>

<p>“The old story of my love for you, Rosaline,”
he said eagerly, advancing nearer the sundial,
the flock of doves rising with a whir of wings
as he approached.</p>

<p>She was unmoved, however, only averting her
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I have spoken to madame,” he added, “and
now I speak to you.”</p>

<p>“And what did Madame de St. Cyr say?” she
demanded, giving him a questioning glance.</p>

<p>“She told me that so great was her love for
her only grandchild that she would never force
your choice, and therefore it remained with you
to decide for yourself.” He spoke with feeling,
his bold blue eyes on her lovely face. “I trust
that you are not wholly indifferent to me, Rosaline,”
he continued, “and I can give you much.
My beautiful princess is shut up here in a
ruinous old château. I will show you the
world—Paris—Versailles. No beauty of the
court will compare with the rose of Languedoc.”</p>

<p>He paused, carried away by his own eloquence,
for M. de Baudri was not given to
sentiment. Rosaline had listened with patience
and composure, and she answered him in a tone
of quiet amusement.</p>

<p>“Monsieur does me too much honor,” she
said. “The château is indeed ruinous, but ’tis
my home, and, strange to say, I do not long for
the splendors of the court—or the flattery of
the courtiers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“But my love for you, mademoiselle!” he
protested in surprise; surely this child did not
realize the honor he paid her. “I offer you my
heart and hand.”</p>

<p>Rosaline curtsied with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>“I am honored, monsieur,” she replied; “but
happily, as my grandmother says, I have the
decision of my fate. My marriage matters to
no one except to her and to me—and, monsieur,
I do not desire to marry.”</p>

<p>He stared at her in such frank surprise that
she had to avert her face to hide her amusement.</p>

<p>“You are only a child,” he said bluntly;
“you do not understand what my name and fortune
would mean to you. ’Tis not every day,
mademoiselle, that a man desires to marry a
young girl without a <i>dot</i>!”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, her blue eyes shining.</p>

<p>“I appreciate your condescension, monsieur,”
she said amiably; “but I am too wise to thrust
myself upon such rash generosity.”</p>

<p>“This is folly, mademoiselle,” he exclaimed,
his temper rising; “or is it only a shamefaced
reluctance to confess your true sentiments?”</p>

<p>Rosaline had borne much, but at this she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
broke down, laughing as merrily and recklessly
as a child; laughing until tears stood in her blue
eyes. Meanwhile M. de Baudri stood in front
of her swelling with rage and mortification, his
face crimson and his blue eyes fierce with indignation.
Still Rosaline laughed.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is merry,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, monsieur,” she replied,
“a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“You have not answered me,” he went on
harshly. “Am I to understand that my suit
is refused?”</p>

<p>“It is refused, monsieur,” she rejoined more
calmly; “M. de Baudri should seek a bride of
more wealth and distinction.”</p>

<p>He stood a moment silent, the picture of furious
indignation, then he looked over the hedge
and saw a man crossing the space between the
house and the wing. M. de Baudri frowned.</p>

<p>“Who is that, mademoiselle?” he demanded
sharply, pointing toward the stranger.</p>

<p>Rosaline’s eyes followed his finger, and she
colored, her composure disturbed at last.</p>

<p>“It is the new steward, monsieur,” she
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“The new steward?” he repeated. “Madame
de St. Cyr refused the man I recommended because
she said she could not afford to pay for a
successor to old Jacques.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” she rejoined quietly; “we
really could not afford it. But since old Jacques
died we have found ourselves in need of a
man to help us, therefore we have afforded it,
monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated M. de Baudri, with another
glance at the house. “A strange sort of
a steward. You had best be careful, mademoiselle,
and not employ disguised Camisards; the
neighborhood swarms with the vermin, and M.
le Maréchal means to exterminate them all.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the caution, monsieur,” she
replied, “but Père Ambroise looks after us very
well.”</p>

<p>“Père Ambroise is a fat fool,” he retorted,
giving a malicious kick at Truffe, who had approached
him.</p>

<p>Rosaline saw it and her face flushed crimson.</p>

<p>“Come here, Truffe,” she said, and then curtsied
to her visitor. “We bid you good afternoon,
monsieur,” she continued coolly; “neither Truffe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
nor I appreciate the honor you have offered us.
We beg you to confer it on a more worthy object,
and we bid you good-evening.”</p>

<p>And away she ran with her dog, leaving M.
de Baudri standing in the centre of the garden,
the image of indignant disgust. The minx had
dared to refuse him, an officer of his Majesty’s
dragoons, when she should have been overwhelmed
by his condescension; but clearly she
was not responsible,—a frivolous child! So he
thought, and rode away, cursing his folly and
the infatuation of Madame de St. Cyr. But, for
all that, he did not mean to lose the Rose of
Languedoc.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A STRING OF TROUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Rosaline was once more
among her flowers. There was no gardener at
the château now, and it was the young girl’s
custom to weed and tend her own flower beds.
She was bending over some velvet-faced pansies,
snipping off the dead blooms and plucking
away the vagrant grass when she heard some
one speak behind her, and looking up saw a
hideous face peeping over the wicket-gate.
Rosaline started and stood erect, viewing her
visitor with a suspicious glance. But Mère
Tigrane—for it was she—was accustomed to
such receptions, and she only grinned more
widely as she dropped mademoiselle a curtsey.</p>

<p>“Have some fish for dinner, my pretty!” she
said in a coaxing tone, holding up a string of
trout; “mademoiselle can have the whole string
for ten sous!”</p>

<p>Rosaline had no thought except one of horror
and repulsion. The face looking over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
gate, with its wide red mouth and yellow fangs,
alarmed her; she did not even look at the fish.</p>

<p>“I do not want anything, my good woman,”
she replied, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“But ’tis fast day, my darling,” remarked
Mère Tigrane, with tender solicitude; “all good
Catholics eat fish to-day!”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s lesson was well learned and she
was on her guard in a moment.</p>

<p>“We have enough fish,” she said coldly.</p>

<p>“But these are so fresh, mademoiselle,” persisted
la Louve. “But then the young lady cannot
judge; permit poor Mère Tigrane to show
these lovely trout to the cook.”</p>

<p>“I tell you that we have more fish than we
can eat,” said Rosaline, haughtily; “you had
better try elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“But think of the bargain, my dear,” rejoined
the old hag, in honeyed tones; “now the
cook will know—or the steward.”</p>

<p>As she spoke Mère Tigrane gently opened
the gate and entered, to Rosaline’s disgust.
She instinctively feared the fishwife and she did
not want her to approach the house. She
moved, therefore, into the centre of the path,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
blocking the way,—a very bad move, indeed,
for it roused all la Louve’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“Now, my dearie, let me sell these pretty
fish in the kitchen,” she coaxed, approaching
the girl and laying her bony hand on Rosaline’s
skirt.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle drew back with horror, dragging
her frock from the talon fingers with a little
involuntary cry of disgust. As she did so there
was a low growl from the hedge and Truffe,
dashing suddenly upon the scene, sprang on
Mère Tigrane. The old woman shrieked,
snatching a knife from her bosom and striking
at the dog.</p>

<p>“Do not dare to hurt Truffe!” cried Rosaline,
throwing herself on the poodle and dragging
her off before she had done more mischief
than to tear the other’s clothes. “Go!” she
added imperiously, stamping her foot; “you
forced yourself in—and see, I cannot hold the
dog! There is a crown to buy you a new
petticoat; take it and go!”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane gathered up the money greedily,
and prudently retired beyond the gate before
she spoke. Her little eyes glittered with rage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
although she smiled broadly at the young
girl.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is generous,” she said; “she
has more than paid for the fish—will she not
have them?”</p>

<p>Rosaline was annoyed beyond endurance.
She still held the dog and she turned a withering
glance on Mère Tigrane.</p>

<p>“Go!” she said sharply, “at once. Let me
hear no more of you or your fish.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mère de Dieu</i>, but my beauty can be angry!”
remarked la Louve. “Farewell, my
pretty, and good luck to you and your dog.”</p>

<p>The old woman made her another curtsey and
still chuckling to herself walked slowly away.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she disappeared behind the tall
hedge when there was a footstep on the path
behind Rosaline and François d’Aguesseau
came in sight. He was soberly dressed like a
steward, and bare-headed, having hurried from
the house at the sound of Mère Tigrane’s
outcry. He found Rosaline still holding the
dog, her face flushed with anger and her eyes
fastened on the opening in the hedge where
her unpleasant visitor had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“I heard a noise, mademoiselle,” he said,
“and thought something had alarmed you.”</p>

<p>“And something did,” replied Rosaline, with
a shudder; “the most dreadful old woman has
been here trying to force her way into the
house.”</p>

<p>D’Aguesseau smiled; old women did not terrify
him, and he set mademoiselle’s excitement
down to her nerves.</p>

<p>“What sort of an old woman?” he asked
pleasantly; “you look as if you had seen a
witch, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“And so I have,” retorted the girl; “a witch
with a string of fish.”</p>

<p>He started; he too had unpleasant associations
with an apparition with a basket of fish.
He remembered the terrible tent at the fair, and
the encounter opposite the Sign of the Golden
Cup.</p>

<p>“Which way did she go?” he asked, and as
Rosaline pointed, he went to the gate, and looked
in both directions but saw nothing. “She has
vanished,” he said reassuringly. “I trust that
she did not annoy you, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“She was teasing me to buy her fish, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
finally pushed into the garden,” Rosaline replied,
“and then she caught hold of my skirt
in her eagerness to arrest my attention. I was
foolish, I know, but, I couldn’t help it, I cried
out—such a horror came over me! Then
Truffe sprang on her, and she drew a knife on
my dog! I saved Truffe and ordered her away,
but I know she was fearfully angry, and—and
I fear her; I can’t tell why, but I fear her!”</p>

<p>“Put her from your thoughts, mademoiselle,”
he said soothingly; “’tis not in the power of
such a wretched creature to hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she replied, still excited;
“we are concealing so much, and she wanted
to get to the house. I was afraid she would
see—” she broke off, her face flushing.</p>

<p>“See me,” finished d’Aguesseau quietly.
“Mademoiselle, I pray that you will not let
my presence add to your anxieties. I fear I
have indeed exposed this house to peril by
accepting Madame de St. Cyr’s beautiful friendship.
If I believed so, I would quit it at once.
My lot would indeed be a miserable one if
I should bring misfortune to the roof that
shelters me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>He spoke gloomily, standing with folded
arms and bent head, his eyes on the ground.
Rosaline loosened her hold on Truffe, who
wriggled herself free and fled away along the
hedge barking angrily. Neither of them heeded
the poodle, however, for their thoughts were of
more serious matters.</p>

<p>“Have no fear, monsieur,” Rosaline said;
“our peril could scarcely be increased. We
are all members of a proscribed religion, and it
is natural that we should all suffer together.
It has been a pleasure to my grandmother to be
able to have you as her guest. We have been
so situated that we could do nothing for our
fellow-religionists, and it is much to her to
do even so little for you.”</p>

<p>“So much,” he corrected gravely. “I was
friendless and homeless, when madame asked
me to stay here, and I wish from my heart that I
could be of real service to you, instead of merely
assuming a steward’s place as a temporary
disguise.”</p>

<p>He paused an instant, watching the young
girl’s downcast face intently, and then he spoke
again, with yet more earnestness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I have been urging Madame de St. Cyr to
leave this neighborhood,” he said,—“to go to
England. No one is safe here, and I cannot
hope much from this insurrection, when I think
of the mighty force that the king can hurl
against these poor peasants.”</p>

<p>Rosaline raised her face, a look of inspiration
on her delicate features.</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur,” she said, “you forget that
the <i>bon Dieu</i> is with us! Surely we must win,
when the Captain of our Salvation leads us.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with admiration in his eyes.
How beautiful she was!</p>

<p>“That is true, mademoiselle,” he replied, “but
it may not be His will that we should conquer
upon earth. The battle must be waged,
and death and destruction follow it. I cannot
bear to think of you and madame here in this
château, in the very heart of it; for, doubtless,
Cavalier will assault Nîmes at last.”</p>

<p>“Madame de St. Cyr cannot go to England,”
the girl said quietly; “she is too old for the
flight. We must face it.”</p>

<p>“Then, mademoiselle, I will remain with you
here,” he declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>She gave him a startled glance, coloring
slightly.</p>

<p>“You promised your mother to go to England,” she
reminded him; “and your single
sword could never defend us.”</p>

<p>“And my presence draws danger—you
would add, mademoiselle,” he said quietly;
“that is true, but I shall not remain in this
house, I shall go to the Cévennes, and there
I can still watch over you a little. I shall
indeed go to England, but not now.”</p>

<p>He spoke with such resolution that she attempted
no reply. There was a pause and
again Truffe barked viciously at the other end
of the hedge, and a glint of red showed through
a break in the thicket, but neither of the two
friends noticed it. At last the girl broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“I suppose the end will come some time,”
she said dreamily. “The old château will be
consumed by the flames that M. de Baudri’s
troops will kindle, the garden will be a desolate
place, and Languedoc will know us no more. I
have lain awake at night thinking of it, monsieur,
and yet I am not afraid. I do not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
why, but I have never been really afraid of the
day when this concealment must end. But oh,
I do pray that my grandmother may escape! I
think of these things, and then I come out and
see God’s sun shining, and hear my doves coo,
and it seems impossible that the world is so
cruel. Is it indeed so, monsieur? Is my life
here at St. Cyr a dream of peace amid the
fierce world? Can it be that this too, that I
have always known, will end?”</p>

<p>His face was sad and stern, and he looked at
her with sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he replied, “I pray that it
may never end. But once I too had such a
dream. I was a little lad at my mother’s knee
in Dauphiné. The sun shone there too, and the
birds sang, and every-day life went on. I had a
father whom I reverenced, who taught me and
guided me, a sister whom I loved, and we were
rich.” He paused and then added, “I am almost
a beggar now—but for madame’s loan which
my father’s prudent investments in England will
enable me to repay. I have neither father nor
mother nor sister. The château is a blackened
ruin, the lands are tilled by strangers. <i>Mon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Dieu!</i> my dream ended as I pray yours may
not!”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s face was full of sympathy, tears
gathered in her eyes, she held out her hand
with a gesture of commiseration.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, pardon me for speaking of it,”
she said, a quiver in her voice; “your sister—oh,
believe me, I grieve with you for so terrible
an affliction. God knows what my fate may
be!”</p>

<p>He took her hand in both his and kissed it.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said gravely, “while I
live I will surely defend you from that awful
calamity. There is no one to require my service—’tis
yours, mademoiselle, and my gratitude
and devotion. Would that I had more to
devote to your protection!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>BABET VISITS THE COBBLER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little hunchback, Charlot, sat patiently
at his cobbler’s bench making a pair of shoes.
The sun was not shining in his window; it shone
on the house across the court, and there was
only a reflected glare to brighten the shop at
the sign of Two Shoes. His door was open, and
from where he sat he could see the two children
opposite, playing on the threshold of their
home. They were not handsome children, and
were clad in patched and faded garments, yet
the shoemaker looked over at them often as he
plied his needle. He heard the voice of their
mother singing as she did her work; he saw the
father come home for his dinner, the two little
ones greeting him with noisy affection. A
humble picture of family life, scarcely worth
recording, yet every day le Bossu watched it
with interest and a dull pain. His hearth was
desolate, but not so desolate as his heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Charlot cut a strip of fine kid and stitched it,
but his eyes dwelt sadly on the house across the
court. He went in and out his own door daily,
but no one ever greeted him; no loving voice
spoke kind words of sympathy when his trouble
was upon him; no friendly hand performed the
little every-day services for him. There was
silence always,—silence and loneliness. The
hunchback thought of it and of his life. He
could remember no great blessings or joys in it.
His parents were humble, and he was the one
misshapen child in a large family. From his
birth he had been unwelcome in the world. A
neglected infant, he fell from the bed to the
floor, and from that time began to grow crooked
and sickly. His mother’s death robbed him of
his only friend, and he struggled through painful
years of neglect and suffering to manhood—but
what a manhood! he said to himself; not
even his own brethren cared for him. The
brothers and sisters went out into the world, and
Charlot would have been left in miserable poverty
but for a kind cobbler who taught him his
trade, and thus enabled the cripple to earn his
own living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>That meagre story of pain and sorrow was
Charlot’s history, and now he stitched away
patiently on his shoes and made no complaint.
No one thought of him as a man endowed with
all a man’s feelings and passions. The little
hunchbacked shoemaker of St. Antoine was not
disliked by his neighbors; he was welcome to
gather up the crumbs of joy that fell from the
happier man’s table, to look on at feasts and
weddings; he was even wanted at funerals—for
he had a strangely touching way of showing his
sympathy; but <i>Dieu!</i> he was a thing apart,
<i>le bossu</i>, a little deformity. No one thought of
the soul caged within that wretched shape, and
looking out on all it desired of the fulness of
life, hungering for a crumb of joy, and debarred
forever and ever.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i>” Charlot said sometimes,
“why didst thou give me the soul of a man, and
a body that is only a mark for pity or scorn?”</p>

<p>A question that could be answered only when
the long and painful journey should be over and
the poor, misshapen body laid to rest. Who can
say in what beautiful form such a spirit may be
clad when the River of Death is crossed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>All these thoughts were in the shoemaker’s
mind as he turned a little shoe in his hand. It
was of white satin and he was making a rosette of
pink ribbon, shaping it like a rose and fastening
it on the toe. He fondled his work and held it
off at arm’s length, admiring it. Another pair of
shoes for Mademoiselle de St. Cyr, but this time
they would come as a surprise. Next Thursday
was Rosaline’s birthday, and the cobbler had
been long fashioning these shoes as a present.
He had never dared offer her a gift before, but
now he owed them so many kindnesses, they
had done so much to help him, that he felt he
might offer this humble return on mademoiselle’s
birthday. That pair of little white satin
shoes stood for much joy in le Bossu’s dreary
life; to plan them, to make them, to buy the
ribbon for the rosettes, had furnished him with
so many separate diversions. In the blankness
of his existence there was one sacred spot, the
château of St. Cyr; in his sad days, the figure of
Rosaline stood before him like an angel. There
was a great gulf between these two, the beautiful
girl and the humble cobbler, and he knelt
down on the farther side and worshipped her, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
he would worship a saint in heaven. And she
knew it not. To her, he was little Charlot, poor
Charlot, and her voice softened when she spoke
to him; her manner was more kind too than to
others; she could afford to be goodness itself to
the hunchbacked cobbler, and she never dreamed
that she held his life in the hollow of her hand.
Great was the gulf indeed, and she stood a long
way off with the merciful sympathy of the angel
that she seemed to him to be. He understood
it all well enough and looked up to worship,
happy to fashion a shoe that pleased her and to
see the light in her blue eyes when she thanked
him.</p>

<p>So it was that he sat stitching mademoiselle’s
little shoe and looking across at the children on
his neighbor’s step; they had finished their
dinner now, and the father had gone back to his
work. Le Bossu’s drawn face was pale to-day,
and there was pathos in his brown eyes. He
waxed his thread and drew it back and forth and
once or twice he sighed. There was no sound
in his house but the ticking of his clock, but
over the way there were the voices of children,
the goodwife’s song, the clatter of dishes. Charlot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
had finished one slipper and put it away,
and was taking up the other when some one
entered the court. His work would be done in
good season, the cobbler thought with satisfaction,
and he was cutting the pink ribbon when
he looked up and saw Babet, the cook and
housekeeper at St. Cyr. Le Bossu tucked the
slipper out of sight and greeted his visitor. She
entered with a quick, firm step, bearing herself
like a grenadier, and dusted the stool with the
end of her shawl before she sat down.</p>

<p>“Well, Charlot,” she said, opening a bundle
that she had brought, “here are my boots, and
the left one pinches me and the right is too
large. I tell you, man, that you never make two
shoes alike.”</p>

<p>The cobbler smiled. “Your feet are not alike;
that is the trouble, Babet,” he retorted; “the left
one is larger than the right.”</p>

<p>“Tush!” ejaculated the woman in disgust,
“do you take me for a fool? I’ve set my right
foot forward all my life, little man, and yet you
say the left is larger.”</p>

<p>“You have worn the flesh off your right,
thrusting it forward, Babet,” replied the cobbler;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
“’tis the way with some noses—they are ground
off, being thrust into other people’s business.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Babet, “’tis not so with
mine. Can you fix the shoe so I can wear it?”</p>

<p>The shoemaker knelt down and patiently
tried on Babet’s boots, while she found fault
first with one and then with the other. It was
evident that she was in no very good humor.
A different customer was this from mademoiselle,
and Charlot’s thoughts were not set on
pleasing her. His guest had left him to go
to St. Cyr and had ostensibly become steward
there; but the hunchback was not deceived.
He had long suspected that the women of
the château were of the new religion, and
now he was secretly convinced of it, and in
d’Aguesseau he saw a grave danger for them.
Charlot was a sincere Romanist too, and his
conscience was troubled, but his heart was
full of sympathy for misery; he had himself
been miserable all his life. In spite of
Babet’s bickering, therefore, he found an opportunity
to broach the subject nearest his
heart.</p>

<p>“Does the new steward suit Madame de St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Cyr?” he asked, as he finally took off the
offending boots and put back the old ones on
Babet’s large feet.</p>

<p>“The new steward indeed!” said she, with a
sniff; “a precious steward!—I have no use for
fine gentlemen without money! What did you
send him to us for?”</p>

<p>“I send him?” exclaimed the cobbler, in
mild surprise. “Mademoiselle asked him to
come to see her grandmother.”</p>

<p>Babet tossed her head. “’Twas all your
fault,” she said emphatically. “I’ve nothing
to say against M. d’Aguesseau himself, but what
need have we for a steward? And what does
he do at once, this fine gentleman?”</p>

<p>Charlot had seldom seen his friend so out
of humor before, and he regarded her in
amazement.</p>

<p>“What has he done?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Fallen in love with Mademoiselle Rosaline,” retorted
Babet, bluntly; “and what use is
there in that? I tell you, Charlot, I am jealous
for mademoiselle; I have no patience with
these young fools—they all do it, from M.
de Baudri down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>The hunchback laid down the shoes, the
pain in his patient eyes, and the lines deepening
around his mouth.</p>

<p>“M. d’Aguesseau is a gentleman,” he said
slowly. “I know who he is. Does—does
mademoiselle—find him pleasing?”</p>

<p>This was too much for Babet; she drew a
long breath and stared at the offender with eyes
of scorn.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Rosaline!” she said; “Mademoiselle
Rosaline pleased with him! <i>Ciel!</i>
why, you fool, she must marry a duke or a
prince. But what is the use of having a young
gentleman hopelessly in love with her and
willing to play at being steward to be near
her?”</p>

<p>Charlot sighed; he was resting his chin on
his hand and looking thoughtfully out into the
court.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said, “if it annoys
mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Annoys her!” repeated the indignant
woman. “If it did—but it doesn’t, bless her
innocent heart; she does not even suspect it
yet. But I see it plain enough. He’s a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
man too, and I might be sorry for him, but
what business has he at St. Cyr?”</p>

<p>With this, Babet arose and adjusting her
little white shawl on her broad shoulders, she
smoothed the folds of her black petticoat, and
giving Charlot some more arbitrary directions
about her boots, stalked out. She crossed the
court and trudged away toward the gate of
Nîmes with a feeling of satisfaction. She had
relieved her mind, and she believed that she had
disarmed the hunchback’s suspicions. Babet
knew that Charlot thought her a Huguenot, and
she took many different ways of deceiving him.
She thought now that she had given a reason
for M. d’Aguesseau’s stay at St. Cyr. It was
a truthful statement, but she had made it to
excuse the presence there of a stranger. No
one knew of her intentions; Babet always acted
on her own impulses and she fancied herself a
wise woman. Her jealousy for mademoiselle
was so genuine that she did not have to feign
her anger; no one was good enough for her
darling.</p>

<p>She left the hunchback in a thoughtful mood.
He did not immediately resume his work; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sat staring out at the door, but he saw nothing.
A vision rose indeed before his mind of a tall,
straight figure, a handsome, strong face, the
voice and manners of a station far above his
own in life. The little cobbler sighed painfully,
his lips tightened, he felt as if some one had
thrust a dagger in his heart.</p>

<p>He was still sitting there, staring into space,
when a large figure darkened his doorway and
a stout man wearing the habit of a priest entered
his shop.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>CHARLOT BURNS A CANDLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> priest’s stout figure seemed to fill Charlot’s
little shop, and he stood with his hands
crossed behind his back looking down placidly
at the shoemaker. He had a round, rosy, face
with a succession of double chins and a nose like
a turnip, but his eyes were kindly and he was
nearly always smiling. Père Ambroise was
popular; hardly a parish priest in Nîmes was
more welcome as a visitor, and none were less
feared. Children ran after the amiable father,
babies crowed for him, invalids were glad to hear
his cheery voice. He was not intended as a
persecutor or a martyr; he was round and the
world was round, and both revolved comfortably
in their own orbits. Père Ambroise was lazy,
and, <i>Mère de Dieu</i>, these wretched Camisards
were as fleet of foot as mountain goats! The
good priest preferred a good dinner and a soft
bed in Nîmes. It was a season of trouble for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
his brethren who were outside of the protection
of the garrison towns, and Père Ambroise was
sorry for them. Chayla had been slain at Pont-de-Montvert;
the Curé of Frugères shot in a
rye field; the Curé of St. André de Lancèze
thrown from the highest window of his own
belfry; others had suffered violent deaths, and
Père Ambroise felt that Nîmes was the safest
spot for his residence. He did not belong to
the missionaries or the prophets, but he raised
his hand against no man, and more than one
sufferer secretly blessed the stout father as he
ambled along the Esplanade, or stopped to chat
with the children.</p>

<p>He wore his usual expression of placidity, a
certain unctuous, well-fed air,—the cheerfulness
that comes from a full stomach and the digestion
of an ox. He looked down with mild compassion
on the drawn face of the hunchback. He
pitied Charlot, but with all his worldly wisdom
he had not the least comprehension of him.
The cobbler greeted him respectfully, rising
from his stool at his entrance.</p>

<p>“Sit down—sit down,” said Père Ambroise,
with good-humored remembrance of the hunchback’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
weariness. “I only came to pay for my
shoes.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he tried the back of a chair with
his hand before trusting his weight upon it.
Being satisfied with its strength, he sat down
with a sigh of relief, and drawing out his purse
slowly counted out the money and laid it on
Charlot’s bench.</p>

<p>“How is the business, my son?” he asked,
blandly; “you seem to be always occupied.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the shoemaker; “thanks to the
<i>bon Dieu</i> I am well occupied. All men must
try to walk, and most men wear shoes.”</p>

<p>“When they can afford them,” supplemented
Père Ambroise. “You have a better trade than
some of your competitors. All goes well with
you, then?”</p>

<p>“As well as usual, <i>mon père</i>,” the hunchback
replied quietly, “I live and I eat.”</p>

<p>“That is more than some do in Languedoc,”
rejoined the father, with his usual placid philosophy,
folding his fat hands on his portly front
and gazing mildly around the shop. “Is your
room above rented?” he asked, after a moment’s
pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Charlot looked up quickly, his face changing
a little, and then he bent over his work again.</p>

<p>“It is empty,” he answered; “I found a
lodger often troublesome.”</p>

<p>“Yet you had one some weeks since,” remarked
the priest calmly, “or I have been misinformed.”</p>

<p>Charlot stirred uneasily. “I rented it for
three days only, <i>mon père</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—for three days,” repeated Père
Ambroise, twirling his thumbs and looking up
at the ceiling; “and your lodger then became
Madame de St. Cyr’s steward. How was this,
my son?”</p>

<p>The shoemaker’s fingers were twitching the
thread nervously.</p>

<p>“It was an accident, Père Ambroise,” he said.
“Madame de St. Cyr knew his family and heard
that he was here.”</p>

<p>“She knew his family?” repeated the priest
again, his twinkling eyes travelling down from
the ceiling to the drawn face before him.
“From what part of France did he come?”</p>

<p>“From Dauphiné,” le Bossu retorted shortly.</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated Père Ambroise, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
up a shoe from the bench and examining it
critically. “From Dauphiné—and his name
is—?”</p>

<p>Charlot laid down his work and looked the
good father in the eye.</p>

<p>“You love the family at St Cyr, <i>mon père</i>?”
he asked gravely.</p>

<p>Père Ambroise nodded his head in assent,
smiling a little all the while and patting the
shoe in his hands.</p>

<p>“Then I pray you to ask me no more questions,”
the hunchback said.</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Père Ambroise, and there
was much significance in his tone.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Charlot took up
his work, cutting away at the sole of a shoe,
and his visitor sat quite still, his fat person
spreading comfortably over the chair and settling
into it, after the fashion of soft, fleshy
bodies.</p>

<p>“You go often to St. Cyr,” he remarked at
last; “do you know that M. Montrevel is determined
to make a clean sweep of these Camisards—of
all heretics, in fact; that he will cleanse
Languedoc of this corruption?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“’Tis the king’s will,” remarked le Bossu,
with a sigh, “but there is much suffering.”</p>

<p>“‘If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,’”
Père Ambroise retorted placidly; “heretics
must suffer—fire here and hereafter.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he rose deliberately and replaced
his purse in his pocket.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said kindly, “take no more
such lodgers—that is my advice, and you know
that I am your friend.”</p>

<p>“I know it, <i>mon père</i>,” replied the shoemaker,
respectfully accompanying the priest to the
door.</p>

<p>The good father moved ponderously and at
the threshold he paused a moment to look
about the court, waving his hand to the two
children who stood gaping at him. Then he
bade Charlot farewell.</p>

<p>“Peace be to you, my son,” he said benignly,
and passed slowly out into the Rue
St. Antoine.</p>

<p>When he was gone Charlot put away his
work and went back to the kitchen and set out
his supper, some figs and black bread. He
could not stitch, he could not meditate, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
troubled. He did not fear Père Ambroise, but
he saw a cloud gathering over St. Cyr. He was
a constant witness of cruelties to the Protestants,
so common then that they scarcely made a
ripple in the placid surface of every-day life.
He saw the chain, the stake, the corpses of
damned persons, and these things troubled him
as they did not trouble other good Catholics.
When the miserable appealed to him, his heart
was touched with sympathy; he never mocked,
he never refused a cup of water, as others did;
he pitied because he too had suffered the
world’s scorn. He could not think of these hideous
things approaching Mademoiselle de St.
Cyr; he would as soon have dreamed of casting
an angel into hell; yet he began now to fear that
the finger of Fate was moving slowly but surely
in her direction. It sickened him; he sat down
to eat, but the bread was as a stone between his
teeth.</p>

<p>While he sat thus, looking at his frugal supper,
he heard some one at the door of the shop, and
went out to find Mère Tigrane. She grinned
her hideous grin at him as he appeared. She
had done a good business that day and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hands were empty and she jingled some coin in
her pocket.</p>

<p>“I have sold all my fish, Petit Bossu,” she
said, “and I’ve been to the château out there
by St. Césaire. <i>Dame!</i> but mademoiselle has
a white skin, whiter than the corpse we saw at
the fair, and her cheeks are pink—but she’s a
fury, <i>mon chéri</i>.”</p>

<p>Charlot frowned. “Is this all you have to
say?” he asked sharply; “I am closing my shop.”</p>

<p>“Close it, my straight-back!” she replied,
mocking him. “I stopped by to tell you that
your lodger was out at St. Cyr,” she added,
bursting into a hideous cackle of laughter at the
sight of his angry face.</p>

<p>“You are a fool for your pains!” he retorted
and slammed the door in her face.</p>

<p>“So ho!” she said, pointing her bony finger
at the door; “you are out of temper, Petit
Bossu, and I such a friend of yours too! The
dog tears my petticoat and the hunchback slams
the door in my face. <i>Viens donc</i>, Mère Tigrane;
they treat you ill, but never mind, my rosebud,
’twill all be well yet for the good old woman
and her dear little fish!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>And she took herself off, laughing and mumbling
as she went.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within the house, le Bossu left
his supper untouched, and toiling up the ladder
to his room, reverently lighted a taper before
the shrine of the Virgin. He fell on his knees
before it, and remained a long time, a deep
shadow on his worn face, and his callous
hands clasped and raised in an attitude of
supplication.</p>

<p>At that moment the shadows were falling
softly about the white walls of St. Cyr, and
Rosaline stood looking out of the window of
her own room, her face to the east, and singing
softly, in all the joy of youth and innocence.</p>

<p>Ah, the contrast in the lives that touch each
other so strangely in this world of ours!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>A DANGEROUS SUIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame de St. Cyr</span> was leaning back in
her chair, her white hands folded in her lap,
her eyes fixed in an absent gaze on the space
outside the sitting-room window. Opposite to
her, leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece was
the elegant figure of M. de Baudri. He was
watching the old face before him, with indifferent
eyes, a smile on his lips. She was ill
at ease; he was well satisfied. He was the first
to break the pause.</p>

<p>“I think madame will acknowledge that I
am willing to do all that is liberal and kind,” he
said suavely.</p>

<p>“I do acknowledge it, monsieur,” she replied,
in troubled tones, “but the child—you know, M.
de Baudri, that I have never treated Rosaline
as other girls are treated. She is accustomed
to deciding for herself, young as she is, and—she
does not listen favorably to your suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>He waved his hand airily. “The whim of a
child, madame, the natural coyness of a young
maiden. I honor mademoiselle, for her hesitations,
but between us there need be no
such conventionalities. I desire to marry your
granddaughter, and I flatter myself that you do
not object, madame.”</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on her haughtily as he
spoke; there was a covert threat in his tone,
despite his affable manner. The old woman
sighed.</p>

<p>“’Tis hard for me to explain,” she said
plaintively; “I can have no objections to
you personally, M. de Baudri, but I am
averse to doing anything to force Rosaline’s
inclinations.”</p>

<p>He smiled scornfully. “Madame does not
expect me to believe in so flimsy an excuse,
surely?” he remarked with a frown. “I never
heard that the whims of a mere girl controlled
arrangements of this kind. My marriage
with your granddaughter would benefit you in
many ways. The de Baudris confer an honor
when they marry.”</p>

<p>A red spot flamed in madame’s white cheeks;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
her situation had made a coward of her, but
there was a limit even to her endurance.</p>

<p>“The St. Cyrs thank monsieur,” she said
ironically, “but they also are of noble blood.
No man could confer an honor on the daughter
of the house; she will confer it, when she makes
her choice. We are poor, M. de Baudri, but
we ask favors of no one.”</p>

<p>He saw his error, and bowed low before the
old dame, his hand on his heart.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is an angel,” he said; “if I
did not recognize that, I would not, a second
time, sue for her hand. I also am proud,
madame.”</p>

<p>The old woman returned his bow, but was
silent. She was hurt, angry, alarmed. She
began to fear those handsome, bold eyes,
and the smooth voice; after all, he was like a
panther, ready to spring, and her beautiful
darling, the idol of her old age was the object
of his desire. But for that fearful danger,
their concealed religion, she could have faced
him well enough, but he had a mighty weapon
in his hand, and she almost feared that he knew
it. For herself, death would be no great hardship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
but for Rosaline—she shuddered, pressing
her handkerchief to her lips, and staring
out of the window. Meanwhile M. de Baudri
watched her narrowly; he knew far less than she
thought, but he was fiercely in love with Rosaline,
and such love as his was as dangerous as
hate. The girl’s indifference enraged him;
he would have her, and then—Mother of
Heaven! he would teach her to scorn him,
indeed! He would break her will and humble
her into his slave. Madame de St. Cyr felt all
this, vaguely, it is true, but still strongly enough
to make her recoil from him. What could she
do? she thought, a helpless old woman with all
the world against her! Père Ambroise loved
the child, it was true, but might not Père
Ambroise favor an orthodox lover? M. de
Baudri’s smooth voice broke in on her troubled
thoughts, and demanded her attention again.</p>

<p>“You have advanced no reasonable objections
to my suit, madame,” he said affably; “I
shall therefore regard it as accepted by you,
and only in abeyance on account of mademoiselle’s
maidenly scruples.”</p>

<p>“But I have not accepted it,” she protested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
greatly troubled; “I will not accept any offer
for the child that—that does not give her happiness.
Why should I desire to part with the
jewel of my old age? You are naturally forgetful
of my situation, monsieur; Rosaline’s
marriage would leave me desolate.”</p>

<p>“Nay, madame,” he replied, not ungracefully,
“you would but gain a son. If this is your
only scruple—is it not a selfish one?”</p>

<p>Poor Madame de St. Cyr was fairly cornered.
He saw it and laughed in his sleeve.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, M. de Baudri,” she faltered,
“but after all it rests where it did. Rosaline
must decide.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Then, madame, you virtually acquiesce,”
he said blandly; “for I trust that I can
win so young and amiable a girl as mademoiselle—if
you give me a fair opportunity.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, smiling faintly. “You
have had opportunity, M. de Baudri,” she replied;
“’tis not in my mind to influence her
in any way. She must choose for herself.”</p>

<p>He was all smooth amiability now; he took
his plumed hat from the table and stood a
moment longer on the hearth-rug, the picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of ease and assurance,—his curled periwig, his
lace cravat, his military coat, all of the latest
mode.</p>

<p>“I will undertake to win mademoiselle’s consent,”
he said. “Permit me, however, to remark
that your ideas on the matter are—to say the
least—unconventional. But no matter, ’twill
be a little romance. There is one thing, though,
I would say, madame, and that is, I notice with
surprise that you keep that fellow as steward
still. I spoke to you before.”</p>

<p>A faint flush rose on the old dame’s pale face
and her eyes kindled. She was not yet accustomed
to dictation.</p>

<p>“The man is useful to me,” she said shortly.
“Monsieur forgets that he is not yet one of
my family.”</p>

<p>De Baudri bit his lip, an ugly look in his blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“I beg madame’s pardon,” he said, “but she
probably remembers the cause of my protest;
a grave one,—I believe the rogue may be a
concealed Camisard.”</p>

<p>Madame de St. Cyr’s hands trembled, and she
controlled herself with an effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“I think you are mistaken, M. de Baudri,”
she protested; “he was well recommended, and
I have seen nothing to indicate—that he was
other than he claimed to be.”</p>

<p>“You can see that he is no steward by profession,
though, madame,” retorted the officer,
coolly, “and his presence may be dangerous
at St. Cyr.”</p>

<p>“He has done his duty so far, monsieur,” she
mustered courage to reply, “and I have no pretext
for his discharge.”</p>

<p>De Baudri shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Madame should not need a second warning,”
he remarked, with much suavity; “perhaps
’twould be well for me to investigate his antecedents
and thus relieve madame of farther
embarrassments.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, monsieur,” she said, with an
effort to be calm, “I can see to the matter
myself. I will refer it to Père Ambroise. If
any one is anxious about our spiritual welfare,
he should be.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, madame,” M. de Baudri replied
pleasantly, “but Père Ambroise is notoriously
easy-tempered. I should advise you to be careful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
You cannot afford to harbor a heretic
here; a word to M. de Bâville—” He broke
off, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>Madame stirred uneasily in her chair. Every
word that he had uttered had been a covert
threat, and she knew well enough to what
end it all tended. He loved Rosaline and he
meant to have her. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” thought
the old woman, “he would have the child even
against her will! Can he be wicked enough
to try to intimidate her,—to force her into a
marriage?”</p>

<p>She awoke from these reflections to find him
making his adieux.</p>

<p>“I have warned you, madame,” he said benignly.
“Convey my devotion to mademoiselle—my
regret that she is absent from home at
this hour. I will soon present myself again;
meanwhile, madame, rest assured of my faithful
friendship.”</p>

<p>He bowed profoundly, his hand again on his
heart, and retired, leaving the poor old woman
collapsed in her chair; nor did she breathe
freely until she heard his horse’s hoofs on the
road to Nîmes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Meanwhile a very different scene had been
enacted in the kitchen. Babet was making a
<i>ragoût</i> over the fire; the steward leaned against
the window, posted there to watch for the visitor’s
departure; the hunchbacked cobbler was
by the door, and in the centre of the room
stood mademoiselle herself, although she was
supposed to be out,—mademoiselle in flesh and
blood, and a picture to look at in her malicious
triumph over her escape. She wore a white
print frock, the neck open enough to show her
full, fair throat, and the half-sleeves revealing her
round, white arms. Her golden hair had half
escaped from its braids and rippled about her
rosy, dimpled face, and her blue eyes danced
with merriment. It was her birthday, and M. de
Baudri had brought a suitable gift, an enamelled
casket, but she held in her hands two little white
satin shoes with pink rosettes, and the shoemaker’s
drawn face was lighted with a reflection
of her pleasure.</p>

<p>“You are surely a magician, Charlot,” she
said, admiring them for the twentieth time.
“I know these are enchanted slippers, and in
them I shall walk into the palace of my dreams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
where there is no trouble, and Babet and I do
not have to conjure a dinner!”</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle, if I could but make such
shoes!” exclaimed le Bossu, with a smile; “the
poor cobbler of St. Antoine would be made a
marquis.”</p>

<p>“’Tis better to give happiness than to be
rich, Charlot,” she replied, “and you have given
me so much pleasure to-day that I can even endure
M. de Baudri’s visit in the parlor!” and
she laughed gayly.</p>

<p>“If he hears you laugh, mademoiselle, he
will stay to dinner,” remarked Babet grimly,
looking over her shoulder as she stirred the
stew.</p>

<p>“You have found a way to make me as still
as a mouse, Babet,” Rosaline said. “Has he not
gone yet, M. d’Aguesseau?”</p>

<p>François shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>“As a suitor he has the patience of Jacob,
mademoiselle,” he replied.</p>

<p>Rosaline made a little grimace and blushed,
turning away from him with a gesture of impatience.
The little hunchback, watching the
two, read her mood more truly than she read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
it herself, and his new-born pleasure died out
of his face.</p>

<p>“I shall wear these shoes to-night, Charlot,”
she hastened to say, her back turned on the
supposed steward. “They are fit for a ball, but
I never go to balls, so I will wear them on my
birthday as the greatest honor I can pay them.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle makes me happy by wearing
them at all,” Charlot replied simply.</p>

<p>D’Aguesseau was now looking intently out of
the window.</p>

<p>“M. de Baudri is mounting at the gate,” he
announced. “Mademoiselle, you are no longer
in prison.”</p>

<p>She would not look at him, but she beamed
on the little cobbler.</p>

<p>“I will run and show my present to <i>grand’mère</i>,”
she said.</p>

<p>Charlot followed her to the door.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, a word with you,” he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>She turned in surprise and then beckoned
to him to follow her into the entry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, quickly, a little
alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Mademoiselle,” he said, quietly, “do not
be needlessly afraid, but I would warn you
against an old woman—a fishwife—”</p>

<p>“<i>Ciel!</i>” exclaimed Rosaline; “you mean
that terrible creature who came here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “and she was angry because
of her torn petticoat, I suppose. She is
Mère Tigrane, a dangerous woman, a spying,
mischief-making demon of the market. And—well,
mademoiselle, she saw M. d’Aguesseau
when I first saw him, she tracked him to my
house, she tracked him here. I fear it may
mean mischief; if he goes away it will be better
for all.”</p>

<p>Rosaline was very pale; all the joy died out
of her face; she pressed her hand involuntarily
to her heart.</p>

<p>“I thank you, Charlot,” she said quietly.
“If—if you hear anything—you will tell
me?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, mademoiselle,” replied the cobbler
earnestly, “and—” he hesitated, and then
went on firmly, “will you believe, mademoiselle,
that in all cases—at all times—I am your humble
but faithful servant?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>She looked at him kindly; his devotion
touched her.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I have always believed it, Charlot,”
she said heartily, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>The shoemaker took it with wonder. Her
little soft hand in his! He had never dreamed
of it; he had touched her feet, but her hand!
Poor Charlot, he turned red to his temples and
did not know what she said. And Rosaline left
him and went on to her grandmother without a
thought of her act of condescension. She was
naturally gracious, and she did not despise the
poor as did other young women of her rank.
But the poor little shoemaker went back to
Nîmes feeling that he had been translated; had
he not touched the white hand of an angel of
mercy?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>FRANÇOIS MAKES A PLEDGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was half an hour before moonrise and the
night was supremely still. The warm air of
midsummer stirred not even a leaf on the trees.
There was no sound but the footsteps of three
persons walking through a mulberry grove at a
short distance from the spot where the highroad
from Nîmes turned off to St. Hippolyte. Mademoiselle
and Babet, escorted by M. d’Aguesseau,
were making their way slowly back to St. Cyr.
They had been—at the peril of their lives—to
one of the night meetings of the Church of the
Desert and were returning; cautiously avoiding
observation all the while. Babet led them, her
erect form moving deliberately forward; she
never made a misstep, never hesitated, but held
to her course in grim silence. She did not approve
of their guest’s attentions to mademoiselle.
D’Aguesseau had Rosaline’s hand and
was guiding her, helping her over rough places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
feeling the way where neither of them could
see. They talked together at intervals, in low
voices, and Babet’s ears moved, though she
would have sworn that she scorned to listen;
but she was guarding her ewe-lamb, and in spite
of her convictions that mademoiselle must
marry a prince, she began to be afraid of this
resolute, quiet man.</p>

<p>They walked as rapidly as they could in the
darkness, and leaving the trees behind turned
sharply to the right across an arid plain that
presented many rough and broken places, and
where Rosaline required d’Aguesseau’s helping
hand and his cautious guidance. Then they
followed the dry bed of a stream, walking over
stones and sand, always avoiding the highroad,
but making their way steadily toward St. Cyr.</p>

<p>“It seems a long distance,” Rosaline said at
last with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Long and dangerous for you,” François answered
gently; “I would that we could have persuaded
you to remain at home, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Surely you would not have robbed me of
such a consolation?” she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he replied, in a low voice, “you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
that I would do anything to serve you, but this
was a terrible risk. MM. de Bâville and Montrevel
are both watchful; both suspect that these
religious meetings are held in the neighborhood,
and at any time the troops may descend upon
that old quarry; and there would be no
quarter.”</p>

<p>“Yet we must serve God, monsieur,” Rosaline
said, “even as Daniel did—in peril of the
lion’s den; and as the prophet of Israel was
delivered, surely the remnant of this people will
be also delivered. Truly, monsieur, I would
rather cast in my lot with these peasants, <i>enfants
de Dieu</i>, than live as I do. But my grandmother
is too old and too feeble for the wild life
of the Cévenols, and so I go on—a Papist in
Nîmes, a Protestant at heart.”</p>

<p>“You would join these people, mademoiselle,
yet you have argued against me when I have
proposed to go to the Cévennes.”</p>

<p>“You are under a pledge to go to England,”
she returned promptly; “you have suffered
enough. The time will come quickly for all of
us, I suppose. I do not believe that this deception
can go on. If the soldiers had found us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to-night, I wonder if any of us would have
escaped!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” he murmured softly, “how
terrible it would have been. The sentinels told
me that there were two hundred and fifty women
and children there, besides the men who came
with Cavalier.”</p>

<p>“It would have been death,” she said dreamily;
“we can die but once, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“You would not have died,” he answered
sternly, “while I had a life to give for yours.”</p>

<p>She was silent, but he felt her hand quiver in
his. He could not see her face, nor could she
see his, but each felt the other’s deep emotion.
They walked on, treading carefully; they were
skirting the edge of a field of rye on the border
of the village of St. Césaire, but they had yet to
cross a rocky elevation before they could reach
the château. To the left, the lights of the hamlet
twinkled like fallen stars, and they heard the
dogs baying in the distance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sky, which had been so dark,
became softly luminous, a whiteness spread over
it, the stars paled. At the horizon, the mountains
were sharply outlined, black against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
growing light, while the earth lay in darkness.
Rosaline and her companions began to ascend
a steep path, and as they reached the top of the
slope the moon rose glorious and a flood of
white light poured a searching radiance over the
scene. The white rocks cast black shadows, and
the sandy soil beneath their feet seemed as white
as chalk, while above them a solitary cedar
stretched its branches, dark and feathery, against
a luminous background. Over there were the
spires and turrets of Nîmes, below them the cottage
roofs of St. Césaire, around them a wild
and barren country, suddenly whitened by the
moon.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Babet, harshly, “’tis
a white night—white as a winding-sheet! ’Tis
ill luck, mademoiselle; let us hurry—a dog is
baying at the moon.”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s mood changed, and for the first
time that night she laughed naturally and
sweetly.</p>

<p>“You foolish Babet!” she said, “it is a glorious
night, and you have been to prayers. Where
is your courage?”</p>

<p>Babet shrugged her shoulders. “I’ve courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
enough, mademoiselle,” she said, “but I do not
love to thrust my head into the lion’s mouth.”</p>

<p>With this remark she went on again, leaving
the others to follow. To Babet there were
many things more important than a fine scene by
moonlight, and she did not approve of the slow
progress made by her mistress and her escort.</p>

<p>“A faithful servant,” remarked Rosaline, following
her with her eyes. “She was my nurse
when I was a baby, and she treats me as a child.
Doubtless, monsieur, you think that we lead a
strange life at St. Cyr. I fancy it is very different
from the lives of other women of our rank,
but what else can we do? We are poor, and we
are glad of our humble friend Babet; indeed,
I think that she and the little cobbler, Charlot,
are our most devoted allies. After all, I imagine
that <i>grand’mère</i> and I would be very unhappy
if we were surrounded with state, and had all our
sweet liberty restricted. Were you ever at Versailles,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>“But once,” he said quietly. “I went to try
to see the king. I wanted to petition him for
my innocent sister’s liberty—that I might take
her place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Forgive me!” Rosaline exclaimed; “I did
not think of the pain I should give. Tell me,”
she went on hurriedly, “have you ever seen
Cavalier or Roland? To-night, in the darkness,
I wanted to see him; ’tis true that they lighted
the torches about him, but in that wild illumination
I made out nothing except that he appeared
a boy. But he did not speak like one!”</p>

<p>“He looked very young,” François replied;
“but there is a certain force about him. I
never saw him before, but I shall not soon forget
him, or the poor, crazed girl.”</p>

<p>“Did you think her demented?” asked Rosaline.
“To me she seemed inspired, and surely
she preached a wonderful sermon; still, as you
say, she spoke wildly.”</p>

<p>“I thought her demented,” he rejoined
quietly; “there are so many of these young girls
prophesying. It seems to me that it is more
the result of suffering, of the horrible spectacles
they have witnessed, than a touch of sacred inspiration.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” she admitted, reluctantly,
“but surely such times as these might well produce
prophets and soothsayers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>They were in sight of the château now and
saw the light burning in Madame de St. Cyr’s
room. She was too feeble to go out on such
perilous expeditions and had remained behind
in fear and trembling, praying for their safe
return. When Babet opened the wicket-gate
they were greeted by Truffe’s warning bark, and
she was at the door to greet them with noisy
joy. Rosaline and M. d’Aguesseau went to
Madame de St. Cyr to tell her of the congregation,
and Babet retired to her own domain to
meditate in solitude on mademoiselle and their
visitor.</p>

<p>Rosaline recounted their visit to the quarry
where the Camisards met, and old madame listened
with eagerness, her pale face unusually
animated. She wanted to hear everything,
Cavalier’s speech, the sermon of the young girl,—one
of the prophets of the Cévenols,—the
prayer offered by one of the ministers, the
psalms they sang. But she shook her head
when she heard that Cavalier had sent word to
M. Montrevel that for every Protestant village
that the maréchal destroyed, he, Cavalier, would
destroy two Papist villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“’Twill be useless,” she said quietly; “the
king will pour his soldiers upon us, and Languedoc
will be laid waste; we cannot prevail
against such power. My husband always said
so, and my son. They used to say that if the
Edict of Nantes should be revoked, the Protestants
would soon be destroyed. It will be so—I
have felt it from the first.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>grand’mère</i>, you are not hopeful
enough,” Rosaline said; “see what these two
men—Cavalier and Roland—have already accomplished.
Let us hope that England will
help us.”</p>

<p>Madame shook her head. “The world is
selfish,” she said quietly; then she glanced at
the clock. “Rosaline, call Babet,” she said;
“’tis the hour for our devotions.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper was summoned, while François
looked carefully at the windows and saw
that all the shutters were fastened. Then the
little company joined in evening prayer, Madame
de St. Cyr reading a chapter from the Bible.
They did not sing; not even in that secluded
spot did they dare to give voice to one of Marot’s
psalms, for they did not know what ear might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
be listening in the night. When it was over the
grandmother bade Rosaline good-night and sent
her away with Babet, but she detained d’Aguesseau.
When they were alone she turned to him
with a sad face.</p>

<p>“I fear that trouble is brewing, monsieur,”
she said quietly; “the very presence of Cavalier
near Nîmes increases our perils, and there too
are the Florentines,—the White Camisards, as
they call themselves,—ruffians, in fact, banded
together to hunt us down. I see nothing but
danger and death on every side. For myself, I
no longer fear,” she added with sorrowful dignity;
“I know that I have but a little while to
live, and I would die right cheerfully for my religion,
but Rosaline—<i>mon Dieu!</i>” she clasped
her hands and looked up.</p>

<p>“Madame, if I can protect her—” began
François.</p>

<p>“That is what I would pray for, monsieur,”
she said. “If I am taken, will you aid Babet to
get her out of France?”</p>

<p>“I would give my life for hers!” he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>The old woman looked up at his resolute face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
at the light in his eyes, and bowed her own face
in her hands.</p>

<p>“Madame de St. Cyr,” he said quietly, “I do
solemnly pledge myself to defend her—to take
her away to a place of safety—to fight for her
as long as I live myself.”</p>

<p>She looked up through her tears.</p>

<p>“I thank the <i>bon Dieu</i>!” she said. “To-day
men are like wolves toward our lambs. You
see how gentle, how innocent the child is.”</p>

<p>She held out her thin, white hand and he
took it, and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said gently, “I love her.”</p>

<p>The old face quivered and flushed a little,
but she was touched.</p>

<p>“I know not how the child may feel,” she
said simply, “but I knew your family, and—I
am content that it should be so. Heaven may
have sent you to be her defender, for I do
greatly fear that the hour of danger draws
nigh.”</p>

<small>THE FINGER OF FATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> months of the terrible summer of 1703
waned, and autumn came. Fire and sword had
laid waste in Languedoc. It had been a reign
of terror. The chieftains of the Camisards
sweeping down from the Cévennes carried the
war almost to the sea; priests were slain,
Catholic villages burned. On the other side,
the king’s soldiers poured into the devoted
country, and the Huguenots were hunted far
and wide. The galleys at Marseilles were
crowded, the jails were packed, the gallows in
constant use; the women and children were
sent to convents and prisons, and the desolate
country threatened famine, with no man to
till the soil, and no woman to bind the sheaves.
Still it went on, that cruel war for religion’s
sake, and the blood of the innocent was poured
out as a libation.</p>

<p>Nîmes was thronged with soldiers, the markets
were crowded, the busy life choked the marts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
but the open country was stricken; even the
valley of the Vaunage—“the little Canaan” of
Languedoc—had suffered. In the court of the
Rue St. Antoine, the little cobbler mended
the shoes of the soldiers, and out at St. Cyr
only one or two late roses were blooming, and
the bees had stored their honey for winter.
The every-day life went on; the steward was
still there, chained by invisible links now; he
scarcely thought of leaving France, and he
knew that he might be needed, for Madame de St.
Cyr was failing fast. She had had an attack of
heart disease, and sat in her chair all day, without
strength to take her accustomed part in
affairs. M. de Baudri still came, a persistent
and undaunted suitor, and Père Ambroise made
his regular visits, walking in the garden with
Rosaline, and discoursing on the perils of
heresy, but closing his eyes to suspicious circumstances.
He always walked with his hands
behind him, his large black figure seeming to
absorb a good deal of the sunlight, and a smile
on his round, rosy face. What was the use,
after all, of making that poor old woman
wretched? he argued comfortably, and he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
not force religious consolation upon Madame
de St. Cyr. He was willing to let the heretic
burn in the next world, and she blessed him in
her heart every time she looked out at him as
he ambled through the maze of hedges.</p>

<p>There had been a season of quiet, a brief
interval in the clash of war, and the family at
St. Cyr breathed more freely. Fear and suspicion
seemed dormant, and Rosaline’s laugh
came more readily, except when she saw how
feeble her grandmother looked.</p>

<p>It was the last of October, and the three,
Madame de St. Cyr, her granddaughter, and
François d’Aguesseau had just finished the
midday meal. It was a golden day, almost as
warm as summer, and a monthly rose swung its
blossoms over the window-sill. M. d’Aguesseau
had been fortunate enough to secure a communication
with his friends in England, and
had received a remittance which enabled him
to pay his debts and to provide for the future.
But he said nothing of a change, for he saw that
Madame de St. Cyr was unable to travel, and he
would not quit Languedoc while Rosaline was
surrounded with so many dangers. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
talking of every-day matters, of the approach
of winter, of the chances for the success of the
insurrection, when they were startled by the
tramping of a body of horse in the road, and
the sharp call of a bugle. Madame’s face paled
and Rosaline and d’Aguesseau sprang to their
feet. She ran ahead of him out at the door and
down the path to an opening in the hedge
which afforded a view of the highway.</p>

<p>“’Tis M. de Baudri at the head of his
dragoons!” she exclaimed, shading her eyes
with her hand and looking out.</p>

<p>A company of dragoons were filing along the
road, the even gait of the cavalry horses keeping
the whole line swinging on to the sound of
the bugle. The gay uniforms were soiled and
there were powder stains, and in the centre of
the troop were six prisoners,—grim-looking
men, in the garb of peasants with the blouse of
the Camisards, and bound, their arms tied behind
their backs and their feet tied under the bellies
of their horses. At the sight of them Rosaline
drew back with a shudder, but it was too late;
M. de Baudri had seen her and drew rein, saluting
her with unruffled composure. As he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
paused, the cavalcade halted opposite the gate,
bringing the prisoners in full view of the château.
They did not look to the right or left, however,
but stared grimly before them. Of the six, five
were wounded, and the blood flowed from an unbandaged
wound on one man’s head. Faint from
the loss of it, he reeled in his saddle, but uttered
no complaint. Meanwhile M. de Baudri sat
erect on his spirited horse, his head uncovered,
his rich uniform spotless, and his periwig freshly
curled. He looked smilingly into Rosaline’s
pale face.</p>

<p>“A fair good morning, my Rose of Languedoc,”
he said gallantly, speaking too low
for the ears of his dragoons; “I count it fortunate
when even my duty takes me past your
door.”</p>

<p>She curtsied, her blue eyes looking straight
before her and her lips firmly closed. She was
controlling herself with a mighty effort.</p>

<p>“Monsieur has surely unpleasant duties,” she
said formally.</p>

<p>“The gayest in the world,” he replied with a
careless laugh. “We have cleaned out a cave full
of Barbets this morning, and hung the leader because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
he had the boldness to be shot in action.
We swung his dead body on a chestnut-tree—it
hangs there with the burrs ready to ripen.
<i>Nom de St. Denis!</i>” he added, with a glance at
his prisoners, “these fellows would have been
lucky to hang there too!”</p>

<p>Rosaline could endure no more.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried, “are you human?
Can you see that poor man bleed to death?”</p>

<p>De Baudri turned in his saddle and stared indifferently
at the sufferer.</p>

<p>“A heretic, mademoiselle,” he remarked, with
a gesture of disdain; “what would you?”</p>

<p>“I would bind his wounds!” she retorted,
taking a step nearer the gate; but the sight had
sickened her, the scene swam before her eyes,
she reeled, and would have fallen but for François,
who had been standing a few yards behind her,
and who now sprang forward and caught her in
his arms.</p>

<p>“Why do you exhibit such cruelties to her?”
he demanded sharply, looking over her head
into de Baudri’s eyes.</p>

<p>The latter had made a motion as if to spring
from the saddle at the sight of Rosaline’s white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
face, but now he straightened himself and returned
the other’s look with disdain.</p>

<p>“So!” he said with a sneer, “the menial turns
into a champion. <i>Mère de Dieu</i>, Sir Camisard,
we will be pleased to accommodate you in
Nîmes.”</p>

<p>“You may sometime have that pleasure, M.
de Baudri,” d’Aguesseau replied, coldly, and
lifting Rosaline’s unconscious form in his arms,
he carried her back into the house.</p>

<p>The soldier remained a moment staring after
them, his blue eyes on fire, then he recollected
where he was and gave an order. The bugle
sounded “Forward!” and the troop disappeared
along the highroad to Nîmes, leaving a cloud
of dust in its track.</p>

<p>Meanwhile d’Aguesseau, fearing to alarm
Madame de St. Cyr, carried Rosaline into the
hall and summoned Babet. But the girl began
to recover without any ministrations, and sat up
on the high settle by the door, the soft air reviving
her; but her joyous mood was gone,
she looked out into the garden with unseeing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she said faintly, “I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
happy—and all this misery at my door! I
live a lie secure, and these martyrs die for their
religion. What a poor creature I am!”</p>

<p>Babet stood looking at her with a grim face;
d’Aguesseau was silent, his own conscience
accusing him.</p>

<p>“It will not last,” Rosaline went on slowly,
“I feel that trouble is coming to us! What
right have we to stand by and see it all and rejoice
in our false security. Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, that
poor man!”</p>

<p>“It’s no use to seek trouble, mademoiselle,”
Babet remarked, “it’ll find us fast enough. I
hear it grumbling like the thunder in the
Cévennes mountains. As for that poor man,
never you mind; Cavalier will catch some fat
old curé for him!”</p>

<p>Retaliation was a salve to Babet’s moods; she
was no saint and had no longing to be a martyr.
Rosaline shook her head.</p>

<p>“It must end,” she said, rising. “I will go
to my grandmother. You may cut the flowers
to-day, Babet.”</p>

<p>She passed d’Aguesseau without a word;
her emotion seemed to have separated her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
from him, and all that day she was sad and
preoccupied.</p>

<p>As for François d’Aguesseau, he went out
through the garden and passing the mulberry
trees, descended a steep slope to the banks of
a stream which flowed behind St. Cyr. Following
this, he passed through a little forest of
chestnut trees, heavily laden with green burrs,
and came at last to a deserted windmill. The
tower was white and solid, and the wheel still
surmounted it though broken in several places,
but the mill had long been unused. The door
stood open—on rusty hinges—and a heap of
straw lay in one corner, doubtless the resting-place
of many a vagrant in those evil times. On
the threshold d’Aguesseau sat down, facing the
stream and the mossy slope. It was a favorite
resort of his, because of its solitude and stillness.
Here many a battle of the heart had been
fought out, and here he came now to face another
crisis. He sat there a long while, and it was
very quiet. Now and then a chestnut burr fell
with a soft thud in the little grove behind him;
a squirrel came to the edge of the bank and
then leaped away; a fish jumped out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
water and then plunged down again. Presently
the breeze freshened, the old windmill creaked
as it turned a little, and the leaves rustled
softly. At last the sun sank lower in the west
and sent long rays of light through the trees,
and the clouds overhead grew rosy.</p>

<p>François rose and walked toward the château;
he was resolved to live thus no longer. His
presence was now more of a menace than a
protection to the women there. He had read
the look in M. de Baudri’s eyes, and he knew
that he might expect the worst that a relentless
enemy could do. But it was not that; Rosaline’s
words had struck home. He too had been
living a lie in security; he too felt himself a
miserable coward before the self-devotion of
these poor peasants and wool-carders. He
must draw his sword for this forlorn hope;
he must leave St. Cyr—ah, there was the
pang! Could he protect her at a distance?
Could he watch over her welfare while he fought
with the Camisards? That was the chain that
had held him, and now even that must be
broken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE BATTLE HYMN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night, when the shutters were closed
and the doors secured, the family sat in an
upper room. Babet had come in to hear the
Bible read by Madame de St. Cyr, and they
were all grouped about the table where the
candles were burning. The old woman was
reading in a low voice, with many pauses, and
the faces around her were grave and even sad
as they listened. Suddenly the dog sprang up
from her place at Rosaline’s feet and began to
bark, and the reading ceased.</p>

<p>“What is it? I hear something!” exclaimed
the young girl, trying to silence Truffe.</p>

<p>Babet was listening intently.</p>

<p>“I hear the sound of many feet,” she said.</p>

<p>D’Aguesseau rose and went to the window
and, unfastening the shutter, looked out. The
moon was struggling to shine through drifting
clouds; one moment the world was lighted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the next it lay in darkness. In one of these
intervals of illumination he saw the scene without
plainly enough. The garden lay below the
window, and beyond was a view of the highroad,
the sloping plain, and farther off the village of
St. Césaire. He could hear the sound of marching
men, and as he looked they came in sight on
the road, filing slowly past the château, line after
line, their weapons gleaming in the moonshine.
He watched them curiously; these were not the
dragoons,—he could distinguish the rough and
ragged appearance of the men even from a distance.
He closed the shutter and turned toward
the women with a flush on his face; his opportunity
was at hand.</p>

<p>“They are passing the château,” he said, in a
reassuring tone, “I will go out and ascertain
who they are. I think I cannot be mistaken
in them.”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s blue eyes kindled.</p>

<p>“Are they Camisards?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I think so,” he replied as he left the room.</p>

<p>The next moment they heard him go out, and
Rosaline went to the window to watch. Madame
de St. Cyr’s face was very pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“They may be Florentines,” she said, “and if
so—we shall scarcely escape them.”</p>

<p>“They have halted,” her granddaughter replied
from the window. “The clouds have
drifted wide apart now and the night is as
white as that night which frightened you, Babet.
M. d’Aguesseau has gone out to them.”</p>

<p>“The <i>bon Dieu</i> defend us!” murmured
madame; “the times are very evil;” and she
fell to praying silently.</p>

<p>Babet was kneeling on the floor, with Truffe’s
head smothered in her apron to hush the dog’s
bark. Rosaline leaned against the window frame
looking out, the moonlight outlining her slender
figure.</p>

<p>“M. d’Aguesseau talks with one of them,” she
said. “<i>Ciel!</i> how ghastly their faces look in
this light—like chalk—and I see everywhere
the flash of steel.”</p>

<p>“Can you make out who they are?” asked
her grandmother, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>“Nay,” she replied, “but M. d’Aguesseau is
friendly with them,—I can see that; he has
shaken hands with one who seems to be a
leader.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“It is well,” said madame, in a tone of relief;
“they must be of our people.”</p>

<p>The night was very still and the three women
listened, but they did not distinguish the words
that were spoken, though they heard the voices.</p>

<p>“Does M. d’Aguesseau still speak with
them?” the old woman asked.</p>

<p>“He is coming back alone,” Rosaline replied
in a low tone; and she did not leave her post
when she heard him coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>He entered the room quietly, though he had
his sword in his hand.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “I came back to reassure
you. These men are Camisards, led by Cavalier
himself, and they are on their way to cut off
a train of ammunition that is leaving Nîmes for
St. Hippolyte. There will be a fight, but not very
near here, I trust, and I believe you will be in
safety. For myself, madame, I go with them.”</p>

<p>The old woman clasped her hands and leaned
back in her chair.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she said, “I sent out my two soldiers
to die for their king, and I cannot bid you stay,
since you go to fight in the cause of the King of
kings, but I grieve to part with you thus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>He took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “you have been as good
to me as a mother, in my extremity, and I will
not forget your kindness. May God give me
the opportunity to requite it. I must strike a
good blow in the cause of my brethren, but I
shall not forget my duty to you—and yours.”</p>

<p>Tears fell on her white cheeks, and she gave
him her blessing.</p>

<p>Leaving her, he walked over to the window
where the young girl had remained motionless as
a statue, her face set toward the scene without.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said very low, “I bid
you adieu. I know that you have thought me
lacking in the spirit to fight—but believe me,
it was not cowardice that held me at St. Cyr.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, her blue eyes clear
and fearless.</p>

<p>“The cause is sacred,” she said. “I—I am
glad that—”</p>

<p>She broke off, and he filled up the sentence.</p>

<p>“Glad that I have the courage to go,” he
said coldly.</p>

<p>“I never doubted that,” she replied gravely;
“but oh, monsieur, if I could be a man, I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
fight—I can understand how you feel—the
<i>bon Dieu</i> defend you!”</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment sadly, and seemed
to hesitate; then he turned and went quietly
away, leaving her standing there tongue-tied,
her eyes suddenly filled with hot tears. What
had she done? she thought, as he went down
and out into the night. What had she done?</p>

<p>Her grandmother’s voice roused her.</p>

<p>“Has he gone to them?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rosaline replied, “and they are forming
in columns again,—they are going to
march on.”</p>

<p>There was a pause; the women could hear
that there were some orders given and then
it was strangely quiet, the men standing like
statues in the road. The clouds drifted over the
moon and darkness enveloped the scene again,
and out of that still night arose the murmur of
many voices, a volume of sound, throbbing and
gaining strength and sweetness and solemnity.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Rosaline, raising her hand,
“the Sixty-eighth Psalm—the battle hymn.”</p>

<p>Full and strong it rose, every word poured
out from the hearts of those stern men, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
that lonely spot, in the darkness, the sound was
profoundly solemn. Softly at first, and then
sweetly and fearlessly, Rosaline joined them,
her rich young voice floating out to mingle
with the song of the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>The last verses grew softer as they marched
away, and the singing died at last in the
distance.</p>

<p>Rosaline remained at her post, straining her
eyes to search the darkness, and Babet, releasing
Truffe, came and stood beside her. They
could see the distant lights of St. Césaire, and
this window in the daytime commanded a view
of the road that led in the direction of St.
Hippolyte. It was an hour of suspense, and
none of the women thought of sleep. Old
Madame de St. Cyr lay back in her chair,
engaged in silent devotion, and the others
watched and watched with tireless eagerness.
The very stillness was oppressive, and the
darkness now was like a pall, close over the
earth.</p>

<p>“<i>Ciel!</i>” said Babet, “how quiet it is!—and
black as soot. I wonder how many men he
had?”</p>

<p>“There seemed to be an army,” replied
Rosaline, “but I suppose it could not be that
he had more than a thousand men, perhaps not
so many, and Nîmes is a hive of soldiers!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” ejaculated the other woman, grimly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
“Cavalier can whip them—he’ll have M.
Montrevel’s periwig yet.”</p>

<p>Rosaline did not reply, her mind was elsewhere;
she was thinking of that dangerous
march into the enemy’s country, of the fight
that must ensue.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a distant sound—the
fire of musketry—the first clash of battle,
borne to them on the night air, and at the
same moment they saw the lights flashing red
in St. Césaire.</p>

<p>“They have met the enemy!” Rosaline exclaimed,
straining her eyes and ears and leaning
out of the window.</p>

<p>They could hear firing quite plainly now;
and presently far off they saw a blaze kindled,
and then the flames leaped up into the night,
like fiery swords cutting the blackness in twain.</p>

<p>“They have set fire to the old château over
there,” Rosaline said.</p>

<p>Madame de St. Cyr turned in her chair.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you see,” she exclaimed
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Fire, <i>grand’mère</i>, leaping up in the night,
and I hear the guns,” Rosaline replied, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
now—see, see, Babet!—there are black figures
outlined against the flames! Ah, <i>Dieu</i>, they
fight!—’tis a part of the battle—oh, if I could
but see it plainly!”</p>

<p>The rattle of small arms came to them, and
now the boom of heavier guns.</p>

<p>“They have brought artillery from Nîmes,”
said Rosaline, in a low voice. “Ah, see, Babet,
another house has caught! ’Tis the village in
the highroad yonder; how it burns! The night
is gaping as though we looked into a fiery furnace.
Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, what a fearful sight it is!
There! something exploded—see the timbers
flying—some one perished when they fell.”</p>

<p>She leaned from the window and gazed at the
wild night with a throbbing heart.</p>

<p>“Can you not see, Babet?” she cried. “I do—they
fight there in the firelight—see their
black figures—hush! there is a heavy gun.”</p>

<p>“My eyes are old,” Babet replied; “to me ’tis
the mouth of the infernal regions—no more.”</p>

<p>Another pause while madame prayed softly.</p>

<p>“How goes it?” she asked again.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell—I cannot tell!” cried Rosaline,
“but the fire has consumed the houses, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
think. It seems to sink now, and I cannot see
so well.”</p>

<p>Again they watched in silence; but now the
firing seemed to grow more distant, and finally
they heard it no more, though the flames still
made the night as red as blood. An hour passed—two—and
they watched, and could see no
more, and could only divine the cause of the
silence.</p>

<p>“Cavalier must have been driven back,”
madame said, “else the fighting would have
lasted longer. May the <i>bon Dieu</i> guard our
poor fellows!”</p>

<p>Again there was stillness, and the clock struck
four, the clear little bell startling them. Rosaline
closed the shutter softly; her face was as
white as snow.</p>

<p>“’Tis over,” she said; “the flames have died
away, darkness is there again, and silence—and
death!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>“AND ALL FOR LOVE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day dawned calm, after the night of suspense;
the October sky was full of light clouds,
and there was a chill in the air, the first suggestion
of winter, and the birds twittered in the ivy
that clung below Rosaline’s window. The daylight
found no roses in her cheeks, but rather a
new consciousness of pain in her blue eyes.
From an almost childlike innocence and calm,
her heart had been awakened; life in its fulness
had come upon her, and with it the sense
of insecurity. All that she cared for was threatened
with terrible dangers; her own every-day
life might pass like a dream and she might find
herself shut in by grim prison walls. They were
not of the “king’s religion,” and imprisonment,
banishment, death awaited them.</p>

<p>She looked out over the tranquil scene with
an anxious heart. What had happened yonder
in that murky night? Who had fallen? She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
could see soldiers on the distant highroad, and
now and then a train of wagons moving slowly
in the direction of the St. Hippolyte road, but
these things told her no more than the flames
of the night before. Cavalier had been repulsed,
no doubt, but how many had fallen? She could
not tell, and her heart throbbed and her hands
trembled as she busied herself with the morning
tasks. She and her grandmother sat down as
usual to breakfast, but she could not eat; she
quietly fed Truffe with her meal. Madame de
St. Cyr herself scarcely touched anything, and
Babet removed the dishes with a gloomy face.
There was no conversation, there could not be
while the terror of the night was upon them, and
d’Aguesseau’s vacant chair seemed to mock
them.</p>

<p>Once during the day Madame de St. Cyr let
her knitting fall in her lap and looked at Rosaline
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she said quietly, “I fear I shall
never see him again—and he was a brave man.
But for me he would have gone long ago.”</p>

<p>Her granddaughter looked at her strangely.
“Did you urge him to stay here?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“I prayed him to be near us,” the old woman
replied. “I felt that I might go, and there would
be no one to help you. Père Ambroise would
be all on M. de Baudri’s side.”</p>

<p>“And you told M. d’Aguesseau that?” exclaimed
Rosaline, her face flushing.</p>

<p>“Something like it, yes,” Madame de St. Cyr
rejoined sadly; “but the call came and he
obeyed it. May the <i>bon Dieu</i> protect him and
us.”</p>

<p>Rosaline made no reply, but went out of the
room and up the stairs to her own, where she
knelt in the window recess, her head on her
arms. This, then, was the key to all that she
had not understood. He had stayed to protect
them, to serve them, and but for that might
perhaps have been in England, and her grandmother
had demanded this return for her friendship.
Rosaline’s face burned; she did not
look up, even when Truffe came in search of
her and thrust her head into her mistress’s lap.</p>

<p>Presently, however, she heard a horse stop
at the gate, and peeping cautiously through her
screen of ivy, saw M. de Baudri, resplendent
in gold lace, coming up to the house. An ill-enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
omen at such a time, she thought, and
remained at her post, refusing to go down when
Babet was sent for her. She heard his voice,
smooth and pleasant, in the room below, and
after a while she saw him go away again, sitting
very erect in his saddle, the picture of a soldier.
After his departure she found Madame de St.
Cyr sad and nervous. He had told her of the
skirmish with Cavalier, speaking of the affair
with contempt. The dragoons had beaten off
the Camisards, killed twenty and taken sixteen
wounded prisoners. He had come to press his
suit again and to covertly threaten Madame de
St. Cyr. The old woman did not tell all to
Rosaline; she dared not. But the girl read
much in the anxious eyes that followed her as
she moved about, waiting on her grandmother,
for she had sent Babet to Nîmes, to learn from
Charlot, if possible, the names of the prisoners,
the list of the dead. It would be an infinitely
difficult task to learn this without suspicion;
but if any one could help them, the little cobbler
could, and he was known to be of the
king’s religion.</p>

<p>Never did a day drag more wearily, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
last the sun descended toward the west, the
shadows lengthened, and Rosaline’s doves came
cooing to their rest. Babet had not returned
yet from Nîmes. Madame de St. Cyr had her
supper, served by her granddaughter, and then
Rosaline went out with Truffe. She walked
slowly through the garden, where the autumn
had already laid its fingers, and then she passed
out into the grove of mulberry trees, where the
path led to the old windmill. The sun had set,
and the clouds were red and purple overhead,
and between them were great rifts of pale blue.
The mulberry leaves rustled softly; but save
for that it was still. The air was chill, and the
openings between the trees made broad avenues
of light and shade.</p>

<p>Rosaline had walked but a little way, when
the dog sprang forward with a quick, short
bark of welcome, and she saw a man coming
toward her. At the sight of his face she stood
still, her own turning from white to red. A
moment ago she had thought of him as perhaps
lying in some loathsome dungeon in
Nîmes, or dead, and this sudden meeting took
away her self-control; she was trembling when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
he came up. Looking at her, he read more in
her eyes than he had dared to hope for.</p>

<p>“I have come to assure myself of your safety,
mademoiselle,” he said quietly, “and then to
go away again.”</p>

<p>“Babet is in Nîmes now, monsieur, trying to
find out the names of the prisoners,” Rosaline
replied. “We did not know what had happened
and we feared the worst.”</p>

<p>“It was a short, sharp battle,” he said. “We
took some ammunition, but they brought up
reinforcements from Nîmes and we were forced
to fall back. Cavalier is a soldier, indeed.”</p>

<p>“M. de Baudri was at the château,” she rejoined.
“He told us of the dead and the
prisoners, and my grandmother could not rest
until she knew.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and he watched her
face.</p>

<p>“And you, mademoiselle?” he asked gravely.</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the ground.</p>

<p>“I also was anxious, monsieur,” she said
with an effort.</p>

<p>“Yet last night you wished me to go,” he remarked,
unmercifully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>She turned toward him with a grave face.</p>

<p>“I did not know until to-day, monsieur,”
she said, “that my grandmother had asked
you to stay with us to protect us—’twas
more than she had a right to ask.”</p>

<p>“Not more than she had a right to ask,” he
replied, “but I remained for another reason—can
you not divine it, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>The blue eyes avoided his, and the color came
back into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I have no right perhaps to tell you now,
when the future looks so dark,” he said, “and I
have felt that you were displeased at my inactivity.
Yet—last night—when I was facing
death I longed to speak—to tell you all that
was in my heart—even if you were indifferent.
Love cannot always be silent—God forgive me
if I break in upon your innocent peace with my
life and its passions and regrets. The world was
desolate when I saw you—I had lost all—and
then I looked out of my darkness and saw your
face. I cannot but speak—we must part now
and I must know if you care—ever so little.
<i>Dieu!</i> how black the world was when I saw
this tall, white lily! You told me last night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
that you were glad to have me go—I am a
fool, no woman ever said that to the man she
loved.”</p>

<p>He paused, and the leaves rustled overhead.
Her face was averted and he could not see
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said hoarsely; “I did
not mean to speak—but one cannot always
smother the heart’s utterances! You are so
young, so beautiful, so innocent—forgive me,
and let me serve you still.”</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him, but he could
not read her eyes.</p>

<p>“You do not understand,” she replied softly.
“I wanted you to go because—”</p>

<p>“You thought me a coward,” he exclaimed
harshly.</p>

<p>“Nay, monsieur,” she said, “I wanted you to
go because a woman wants the man she—she
loves to be a hero—”</p>

<p>He caught her hands, looking eagerly into
her face.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” he cried.</p>

<p>She smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to be a hero,” she answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
“and when you went I thought—my heart
would break!”</p>

<p>Her fair head was on his shoulder now, and he
kissed her, the perils of their lives forgotten, all
the world changed in an instant and only Love
triumphant. After a while he broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Are you happy?” he asked her softly, holding
her a little away from him that he might see
her face.</p>

<p>She smiled radiantly, but did not answer, and
he went on, questioning her that he might have
a fresh assurance of her affection.</p>

<p>“You want me to go and you do not,” he
said; “what am I to think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I wanted you to go,” she replied, a
flush on her face. “I could not bear to have
you seem less brave or daring than other men—or
to lack zeal for your religion—and then
you went! And—and I cannot bear to have
you go to face danger—even death itself!”</p>

<p>“Oh, thou perfect woman!” he exclaimed,
smiling; “I must be a true knight and yet you
would not have me in danger.”</p>

<p>She smiled, turning her face aside.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, ’tis that,” she answered very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
low. “I want you to be the bravest of the brave,
and yet—oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, I cannot bear to see
you in any danger!”</p>

<p>He held her to his heart again with many
caresses.</p>

<p>“What can I do?” he asked. “I cannot be
both,—your constant attendant and a soldier in
the field. Ah, Rosaline, love is king—not even
the perils of battle can defeat him. I can love
you and fight too, but I cannot flee from danger
for your sweet sake.”</p>

<p>“And I could not bear to see you flee,” she
said, “and yet my heart was torn when I knew
that you were in the midst of that fight in the
darkness.”</p>

<p>“Take comfort, my dearest,” he said softly,
“let us forget the perils and think only of each
other. Ah, my darling, I little thought, when I
was in the cobbler’s upper room so downcast,
that the light of my life would shine in upon
me there. I loved you from the first moment
that I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” she cried with shining eyes, “oh,
tell me—tell me how it was!”</p>

<p>And he told her, Love’s language being eloquent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to such ears, as it has been always, as it
will be while the round world moves.</p>

<p>Then they walked on, hand in hand, through
the trees, the soft moss beneath their feet, the
pale October sky overhead, and only the murmur
of the leaves. They came presently to the
old mill, and went down to the edge of the
stream, and then he asked her again the question
that was first in his thoughts,—</p>

<p>“Are you happy, sweetheart, tell me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, François,” she answered, “we are too
happy—’tis that—I am afraid!”</p>

<p>“Of what, dear heart?” he asked gently,
“surely, not that our love can die?”</p>

<p>“Not that,” she replied, “not that! I have
been light of heart, careless as a child. I never
was afraid before, but now—oh, François, if
you were taken from me it would kill me.”</p>

<p>He clasped her close, laying his cheek against
her soft one.</p>

<p>“But that could not be,” he said soothingly;
“not even death could part us save for a little
while, my heart, for our souls are immortal—and
they are one.”</p>

<p>She clung to him, her eyes full of tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“’Tis so,” she murmured, “our souls are immortal,
I never felt it so strongly before! Love
touches the heart and all the world is different—ah,
<i>mon Dieu</i>, ’tis thy gift to us! See,
François,” she added, “is not the world more
beautiful, the sky more tender? Do not the
birds sing more sweetly to-day? And is it
because we love?”</p>

<p>“It must be so, my Rosaline,” he answered
gently; “the Garden of Eden must have blossomed
so to welcome Eve—and love makes the
world more beautiful each day.”</p>

<p>“And it shall make me better,” she rejoined;
“’tis said that sorrow refines the heart, but it is
joy that fills it with kindness. I am sure of it,
for I was never half so full of pity for the unhappy
as I am now; my cup overflows and
others thirst. Ah, François, let us be good to
others always, for that is love.”</p>

<p>“Your very presence is love, Rosaline,” he
answered softly, “your face, your eyes, your
voice. When I first saw you in the little shop I
was a desperate man, but from that moment my
heart was changed. You entered like an angel,
and as an angel I adored you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“And I made that difference in your life,
François?” she said tenderly,—“I, Rosaline de
St. Cyr. Ah, <i>Dieu</i>, am I not blessed?”</p>

<p>She stood away from him on the mossy bank,
the stream lying brown and placid below her
feet. Behind her the tree trunks were outlined
against the rosy west, and the sweet stillness of
twilight was enfolding them. The afterglow
shone in her beautiful young face, and her blue
eyes were radiant.</p>

<p>“I was never happy before,” she said, smiling,
“now I know it!—but this is happiness—love—life.
Do you see that bright star shining yonder,
François? There is a little one beside it—see!
like two souls, uplifted above the world and
radiant. I will be afraid no more, my love, for
even death has lost its terrors, for thus our two
souls would shine together above the sorrow and
the pain. I will fear no more—for stronger
than death is love!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE TEMPTATION OF LE BOSSU</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shadows had deepened; night already
lay in the little woodland; the distant hills were
purple against the pale horizon. The rising
wind turned the wheel on the old mill; the rusty
vanes moved feebly, as though a cripple waved
long arms in the twilight. The stream rippled,
and here and there a star was reflected in its
bosom, and the leaves rustled continuously now.
The scene was suddenly desolate, perhaps because
the lovers had deserted it, and the darkness
came rolling along like a cloud, rising
from every hollow, lurking in every grove of
figs or of olives, wrapping every object in an
elusive gloom. And away in the distance the
night wind sighed drearily, as it gathered
strength. No spot could have been more quiet
or more lonely.</p>

<p>A man came out of the mill carrying his
bundle, and stood awhile on the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
stream,—a small man with a hump on his back
and a face that showed white even at nightfall.
He remained only a short time motionless, then
he shouldered his bag of tools and followed the
bank of the stream until he came at last to a
bridge, and crossing this made his way to the
highroad leading toward Nîmes. He walked
slowly and painfully, as though he carried a far
greater burden than it appeared, and he held
his head down. The soul of the little cobbler of
St. Antoine was in torment, what matter if his
body walked the earth with other men? Pent
up in the heart of the hunchback were the passion
and longing and anguish of a lifetime.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” he cried out in his bitterness,
“why didst thou give me the heart of a man and
the body of a toad?”</p>

<p>He had had black hours before when he was
well-nigh ready to curse God and die, but never
a worse moment than this. The devil was contending
for the soul of le Bossu, and the darkness
fell, and it seemed as if that road might
lead to hell. And what was he, after all? he
thought; a peasant, a shoemaker, a hunchback!
But, oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i> the long, long years of desolation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the anguish, the hunger for one word of
love, of kindness, of sympathy. What evil spirit
had led him to lie down in that old windmill?
had let him sleep there until her voice awoke
him, and out of purgatory he had looked into
paradise? Like Dives, he had cried out for a
drop of water to slake his thirst, and yet he still
lay in the fires of Satan.</p>

<p>Early that day he had set out for St. Césaire,
and he had done his work in the village, and
before sunset he went up the stream to the old
mill and rested, thinking of mademoiselle in the
château, thankful that she was sheltered and
safe. Sleep had come to the weary cobbler, and
when he awoke Rosaline and her lover were
talking at the door of the mill. He had heard
all, lying there almost in a stupor and he had
remained quiet. It was too late to warn them
of a listener, and was it not best that she should
be ignorant of it? He had heard all; their love
for each other, their talk of their religion, their
hopes and their fears. He was no longer in
doubt of the nature of the dangers that surrounded
them, and he possessed a secret that it
was a crime to conceal; that the State and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Church had ordered every good Catholic to reveal;
and if he revealed it, the lovers would be
separated forever, and he would have no cause
to think of their happiness with such a pang of
miserable jealousy. The poor hunchbacked
cobbler held their lives in his hand, their joy,
and their desolation.</p>

<p>All these thoughts and many more crowded
in upon le Bossu as he toiled along the road,
and it seemed to him that Satan walked beside
him. When a bodily infirmity as great as his
is laid upon a man, there come hours of supreme
temptation, when human nature revolts and the
starved heart cries out in agony and will not be
satisfied. Must one man suffer so, and yet rejoice
to see others happy? A soul is strong
indeed that rises out of such misery clean.</p>

<p>The little cobbler struggled on, and presently
the lights of Nîmes shone in his face and he
entered the gate and passed along the Rue St.
Antoine to his shop. Babet had been there
three times that day to find him, and had gone
back at last to St. Cyr without news, and found
M. d’Aguesseau there, talking with old madame.
Unconscious that he had disappointed such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
visitor, Charlot unlocked his door and entered,
feeling his way until he could light a candle.
There had been another visitor at his door too,
though he knew it not, an old woman with a
red handkerchief around her head, and with a
wide, red mouth. But the cobbler was ignorant
of all these things and went about as usual. He
had tasted nothing since midday, but he had no
appetite and he went up the ladder to his room
and lighted a taper before the shrine there.
After that he threw himself on the bed, dressed
as he was, and all night he wrestled with a temptation
that beset him, with a new-born hatred
of the man whom he had befriended in the
market-place. If he had left M. d’Aguesseau
in that tent with the body of the damned person,
how different the end might have been! Ah,
the desolate soul and the desolate hearth, the
misery and the poverty! <i>Dame de Dieu!</i> some
men possessed the earth and the fulness thereof,
and others starved!</p>

<p>Morning found Charlot stirring the fire in the
kitchen; the commonplace world possessed him
again; he was no longer an individual, only one
of many, the little cobbler of Nîmes. He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
his coffee and he ate his black bread, and then
he went to his bench and worked patiently, finishing
a pair of high military riding-boots.
They were of fine leather, and he fastened burnished
buckles on the high insteps. They were
elaborate, and he had put some fine labor upon
them, and he looked at them now with a recognition
of their perfections; no one made better
shoes than the hunchback.</p>

<p>It was twelve o’clock when he rose and put
the boots into his green bag, and gathering up
his measure and some tools, set out once more.
The streets were full and the cobbler made his
way slowly through the throng. One or two
spoke to him, others noticed him less than the
mule that stood waiting for a reverend father
outside the Garden of the Récollets. Le Bossu
took little heed of it all; his face was drawn and
haggard, and the hump seemed larger than ever.
He walked on until he passed in front of the inn
of the Golden Cup and came to a house a few
yards beyond it. Here he knocked and was
admitted by a man-servant who wore the uniform
of a dragoon. The house had a long,
narrow hall, and at the end of this was a flight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
of stairs, and up these le Bossu was conducted
to the second story. Here the soldier opened
a door to the right, and the cobbler entered a
large room, lighted by three windows, where
M. de Baudri sat eating his breakfast. Charlot
made his salutation, and putting his bag in the
corner, patiently waited the pleasure of his
patron. De Baudri noticed him as little as he
would have noticed a rat or a mouse, and finished
his meal before he even glanced in his direction.
Finally, however, he pushed back his chair and
called the shoemaker.</p>

<p>“<i>Viens donc</i>, Petit Bossu,” he said, “are the
boots finished?”</p>

<p>Charlot took them out of his bag without a
word, and displayed them.</p>

<p>“<i>Sacristi!</i> if I had four legs I should come
to you for boots,” M. de Baudri remarked,
inspecting them. “<i>Diable!</i> those buckles are
too small.”</p>

<p>“The latest from Paris, monsieur,” le Bossu
replied; “his Majesty has a pair of the same
size and design.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri’s face relaxed, and he thrust
out one foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Try them, Bossu,” he said; “and see that
they are good,” he added with a smile, “for I
expect to wear them at my wedding.”</p>

<p>A strange expression crossed the drawn face
of the hunchback, as he knelt to put on the
boot.</p>

<p>“Monsieur expects to be married soon?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p>“<i>Dame de Dieu</i>, I do not know!” de Baudri
exclaimed with a laugh; “my little white bird
likes to use her wings, but—I mean to clip
them.”</p>

<p>Le Bossu smoothed the leather on the officer’s
ankle, and arranged the buckle, his head bent
low over his work.</p>

<p>“Monsieur plans for an early marriage, then?”
he ventured again.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri stared at him.</p>

<p>“<i>Au diable!</i>” he said harshly; “what is it to
you, worm?”</p>

<p>The cobbler made no reply; he was accustomed
to such language from his patrons. He
had put both boots on M. de Baudri’s feet, and
he sat back now on his own heels, looking at his
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Is monsieur satisfied?” he asked meekly.</p>

<p>The officer stood up, looking down at his
feet.</p>

<p>“Very good,” he said at last, “they will do;
but make your bill small, you little beggar, or
you will see that I know how to use them!”
and he laughed coarsely as he sat down and
waited for Charlot to remove the boots and put
on his others, which the hunchback began to
do.</p>

<p>“Curse you, you dog!” he exclaimed, with a
vicious kick at the shoemaker; “you hurt me
in pulling that off!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, monsieur,” le Bossu
replied, with white lips, having dexterously
dodged the kick.</p>

<p>He knew to his cost that there were some
perils attendant upon trying on shoes. He had
put back one of M. de Baudri’s high-heeled
slippers and was taking off the other boot—with
some caution—when the door was opened
by a servant, who came to announce a visitor.</p>

<p>“A miserable old woman, monsieur,” the
man said hesitatingly, “but she will not be
denied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“<i>Dame</i>, send her to the devil—or to the
Intendant!” retorted M. de Baudri, with a grin
at his own joke.</p>

<p>The servant still stood at the door, with a
perplexed face. His master cast a frowning
glance in his direction.</p>

<p>“What is it, idiot?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“She has some information about these
heretics, monsieur,” the fellow answered, stammering;
“she wants money.”</p>

<p>“<i>Âme de St. Denis!</i>” exclaimed monsieur,
with a sneer, “does she take me for a paymaster?”</p>

<p>The servant summoned his courage.</p>

<p>“She told me to say to you two words,
monsieur,” he said, “and they were ‘St. Cyr.’”</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” M. de Baudri cried fiercely.
“Show her up here, you blockhead!”</p>

<p>The man closed the door hastily, and they
heard his hurried steps retreating down the
hall. M. de Baudri fell to cursing, and Charlot
suddenly found that the buckle was hanging by
a thread on the other shoe,—the mate to the
one on his patron’s foot. The shoemaker got
out his thread and his needle, and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
sew the rosette in place, and it was very slow
work indeed.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened again, and Charlot
looked up quickly and saw Mère Tigrane.—Mère
Tigrane, with her blood-red handkerchief
about her head, and her blood-red mouth with
its yellow fangs. She curtsied low to the officer
and grinned as she did when she intended to be
most amiable, but all this had no effect upon de
Baudri; he cursed her roundly and ordered her
to tell her tale and be gone. The old hag took
it in good part, leering at him out of her evil
eyes.</p>

<p>“I have a little news for monsieur,” she
said pleasantly, “a little information about his
friends, and ’tis worth a little money; monsieur
knows that.”</p>

<p>“<i>Diable</i>, you old witch, out with it!” he
said, tossing her some coins.</p>

<p>La Louve grovelled on the floor after them
as they rolled away, her talon fingers clutching
each piece greedily. One fell near the cobbler,
and he thrust it toward her with the end of his
awl, a look of disgust on his face. M. de
Baudri laughed loudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“<i>Dame!</i>” he exclaimed; “there are degrees
even among vermin!”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane gave le Bossu an evil, triumphant
look, and then began to count her
money.</p>

<p>“’Tis not enough,” she said bluntly, turning
on the officer with a sinister smile; “’tis worth
more, my beauty.”</p>

<p>Her insolent tone offended him and he stared
at her.</p>

<p>“<i>Diantre!</i>” he said, “I will have you thrown
from the roof if you do not tell all you know,
you thievish hag!”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane hesitated, looking at the coins
in her hand, but she had a motive more powerful
than greed this time. She changed her tone,
however.</p>

<p>“I’m a poor woman, Excellency,” she
whined; “’tis worth more.”</p>

<p>He threw her a broad piece, with a curse.</p>

<p>“Go on!” he shouted, fiercely; “or I’ll
break your neck.”</p>

<p>She put the money into her wallet and then
licked her lips; there was a good taste in her
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Monsieur knows the family at St. Cyr,” she
said, one evil eye seeming to fix itself on
Charlot; “the old woman and her granddaughter
are there, and a steward.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri was interested now; he frowned
darkly upon her.</p>

<p>“Does monsieur know who the steward is?”
she demanded, her head on one side. “No,
I thought not! ’Tis M. d’Aguesseau,—the
heretic from Dauphiné,—whose father was
broken on the wheel at Montpellier to the
edification of all good people; and his sister
was in the Tour de Constance. Her body
was shown here at a fair. <i>Dame!</i> but her flesh
was white.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri threw her another coin.</p>

<p>“Your information is good,” he said, leaning
back in his chair with a smile.</p>

<p>She curtsied and thrust the money in her
wallet.</p>

<p>“That is not all, monsieur,” she said amiably;
“the young mademoiselle at the château—she
went with this heretic to a prayer-meeting
out there by the old quarry and sang psalms
there. Mère Tigrane knows! And old Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
de St. Cyr, she too is a heretic. <i>Dame!</i> the
château would make a good burning, monsieur.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri turned a black face on her.</p>

<p>“Look you, hag,” he said, “there is more
money. You are well paid, but if a word of
this goes to any one else, <i>nom de Ciel!</i> I will
hang you. Now—<i>au diable!</i>”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane took the money eagerly, vowing
that she would be discreet, and got out of
the room just in time to escape a boot that M.
de Baudri picked up to throw at her.</p>

<p>He was in a storm of passion; he summoned
his servants and ordered one to bring his horse
and the other to get his riding-suit, and then
he went to his room to dress, cursing heaven
and earth in his haste to be off to St. Cyr.</p>

<p>The hunchbacked cobbler had been forgotten,
and when M. de Baudri went out he quietly
gathered up his bag and left the house. His
face was white, but he had never walked so fast
as he did then. He did not go to the shop; he
went straight along the Rue St. Antoine and
out at the gate, and the road to St Césaire
stretched before him, as endless and as steep—to
his vision—as the road to heaven.</p>

<small>A BRIEF DELAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> the old windmill, on the estate of
St. Cyr, the stream turned its course westward
and tumbling over a rock, fell four or five feet
into a broader rivulet and then flowed placidly
on, twisting and turning at last toward the valley
of the Vaunage. The gray cliff’s towered boldly,
hiding the little falls, locking them in a spot as
wild and as deserted as the wildernesses of the
Cévennes. But below, where the stream widened,
the banks were mossy, and in summer
ferns and wild flowers clustered, and on either
bank was a fringe of juniper bushes, and beyond,
the tall, well-nurtured chestnut trees.
Here were fish,—the brown trout darting
through the placid waters, and the eels, and
there were always birds in the trees when the
chestnuts blossomed. But now the touch of
autumn was upon it; the moss showed brown
tints, and the nuts fell from the opening burrs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and the squirrels were gathering their winter
stores.</p>

<p>On the edge of the stream stood Rosaline St.
Cyr, looking down into its clear depths at the
pebbles in its bed. A little way off was Babet
with a basket, and Charlot, the cobbler, knelt
on the bank digging up a hardy fern with a broad
knife, that had been given him for the purpose
by the housekeeper. Truffe meanwhile ran
about under the trees barking at every nut that
dropped. The scene, in its rustic peace and
simplicity, struck the shoemaker in pleasant contrast
with that other scene in Nîmes. He was slow
at his task, taking the root up carefully and lingering
over it so long that Babet grew impatient.</p>

<p>“How long thou art, Petit Bossu!” she said,
her arms akimbo. “<i>Ciel</i>, I could have dug up
forty! We were doing better before you
came.”</p>

<p>“<i>C’est fini</i>,” replied the hunchback, holding
up the fern. “Here it is; how many will you
have?”</p>

<p>Rosaline turned toward him. She had a large
straw hat tied under her chin with blue ribbons,
and her cheeks were like roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“We want four like that, Charlot,” she said
cheerfully; “<i>grand’mère</i> always has a box of
ferns for winter; they make a green spot in the
room, and that is so pretty.”</p>

<p>“But, mademoiselle, ’tis near supper time,”
protested Babet, “and we have been here all the
morning.”</p>

<p>Rosaline laughed—a happy, careless laugh.</p>

<p>“You may go home,” she said; “Charlot will
bring me back when the basket is full, and we
must not lose our dish of mushrooms for supper.
Run along, Babet, and set the kettle boiling.”</p>

<p>Babet was nothing loath, though she grumbled
loudly at the suggestion, but Charlot stopped
digging a fern and looked up with a troubled
face. The woman set down the basket for him
to fill, and he half rose and made a movement
as if to stop her, and then bent over his task
again. Apparently, he had decided to let her
go, and in a few moments her tall figure had disappeared
behind the cliffs and he was alone with
the young girl and her dog. Rosaline was
strolling along the mossy bank singing softly to
herself, the picture of joyful content. She was
walking in a dream of love and youth, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
had forgotten the hunchback. He continued to
kneel over the ferns, but he had paused in his
digging, and his mournful brown eyes followed
her with a mute devotion in their gaze. He did
not know how long he could keep her there, but
every half-hour counted, and surely there was
hope that it would be over before she went back
to the château. He knew what was passing
there, but she did not, and her song almost made
him shudder. Still, he hoped, he hoped much,
that it was only d’Aguesseau who was wanted,
and he was out of reach. The hunchback did
not believe that this beautiful young creature
was in any personal danger. He thought of the
wedding shoes, and bent over the fern with a
frown. What would that handsome savage, M.
de Baudri, do? Ah, that was the question.
Charlot remembered last night and its temptations;
verily, love and hate were nearly akin,
and he had seen the fiend in monsieur’s open
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Rosaline was in a happy mood. She stooped
and gathering a handful of chestnuts, threw
them—one by one—for Truffe to chase, and
laughed gayly at the poodle’s antics, clapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
her hands to make her bring the nuts back to be
thrown again. The hunchback watched her in
silence, bending over his task again; the basket
was nearly full of plumes of fern now, and he
was racking his brain for an excuse to keep
mademoiselle longer away from the house. The
drawn white face was full of anxiety, and now
and then the brown hands trembled as they
handled the plants.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be an early winter,
Charlot?” Rosaline said at last, still tossing
the chestnuts for Truffe.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, mademoiselle,” he replied,
looking up at the sky. “But last night the
wind came howling straight from the Cévennes,
and some say that means a short autumn. The
<i>bon Dieu</i> knows that there will be suffering; so
many of these Cévenols have been taken or
slain, and there were so few to gather the crops
or card the wool. Mother of Heaven, the times
are evil!”</p>

<p>There was silence; Rosaline’s face had lost
its joyous look, and she left off playing with
the dog and walked back to the spot where
the shoemaker was kneeling by his basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Babet says the winter will be fearfully cold,”
she said absently, “and she is wise about these
matters. I know not how many signs she has,
but certainly more than I could ever remember.”</p>

<p>“I do not know about such things,” he answered
quietly, “but the autumn came early
this year.”</p>

<p>Rosaline looked dreamily away toward the
north.</p>

<p>“The winter with its terrible storms, and this
cruel war,” she said thoughtfully,—“I fear the
suffering will be very great, Charlot. How does
it seem in Nîmes? What does M. Montrevel
say?”</p>

<p>“That it cannot last, mademoiselle,” he replied.
“His Majesty has sent great reinforcements,
and the maréchal is determined to crush
the insurrection. Nothing is talked of in Nîmes
save the grandeur of the king and the weakness
of the Cévenols.”</p>

<p>Rosaline sighed; her mood changed entirely
now, and her face was grave and even apprehensive.
There was no sound but the gentle
dash of water from the falls. Presently her
eyes lighted on the basket of ferns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“We have enough, Charlot,” she said, in a
dull voice; “I am going back now. Come also,
and Babet will give you supper; you must be
tired.”</p>

<p>Poor Charlot was at his wits’ end.</p>

<p>“See, mademoiselle, there is a beautiful fern,”
he said, pointing his finger at three waving
plumes of green; “will you not have that
also?”</p>

<p>She looked at it without interest. “No,”
she replied indifferently, “let it remain; we
have more than enough already, and I am
tired.”</p>

<p>She was half-way up the bank, and Charlot
rose in despair.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, “come back, I pray
you; ’tis not yet time to return to the château.”</p>

<p>She looked around in surprise, and the expression
of his face awakened her suspicions.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she demanded quickly; “what
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You were not to return until six o’clock,” he
replied, at a loss for an excuse; “Madame de St.
Cyr so instructed me.”</p>

<p>“Madame de St. Cyr instructed you—about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
me?” exclaimed Rosaline in surprise; and there
was a touch of hauteur in her manner that
Charlot had never encountered before.</p>

<p>“She told me so, when she sent me after you,
mademoiselle,” he answered humbly.</p>

<p>Rosaline was roused now; she stood looking
at him with a searching glance.</p>

<p>“Why did you come to St. Cyr to-day?” she
demanded imperiously.</p>

<p>The hunchback was not adroit, and he felt
the peril of the moment too deeply to find
ready replies.</p>

<p>“I brought some shoes for madame to try,”
he said lamely.</p>

<p>“That is not true, Charlot!” she retorted
indignantly; “madame has ordered no shoes,
and you know it. You came for something,” she
went on, with increasing agitation; “be honest,—was
it—did it concern M. d’Aguesseau?”</p>

<p>The shoemaker looked at her with dull eyes,
his pinched face unusually brown and haggard.</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle,” he replied with an effort,
“it concerned M. d’Aguesseau. M. de Baudri
received information that he was a heretic, and
he has come to St. Cyr to take him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Mademoiselle turned on him the face of an
avenging angel.</p>

<p>“And you—” she said, with passionate scorn,
“did you betray him?”</p>

<p>The hunchback’s lips twitched, like those of a
person in sudden bodily pain, and he did not
reply.</p>

<p>“You miserable creature!” Rosaline continued,
her blue eyes sparkling with anger.
“Did you offer him shelter at first, and get
him here that you might surely betray him?
You are baffled, thank God; you are out-witted!”</p>

<p>Charlot’s hands clenched and he looked at
her as if she had struck him.</p>

<p>“<i>Sang de Dieu</i>, I am innocent!” he said
solemnly; “I never betrayed him. I came here
to warn him, and found that he had gone. I
heard it all in M. de Baudri’s rooms, and I hurried
away, and by hiring a cart that I met in the
road, I was at St. Cyr just five minutes before
the dragoons came, and madame sent me here
to keep you out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p>“The dragoons at St. Cyr!” cried Rosaline,
forgetting all else in that announcement, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
my grandmother there alone! <i>Dieu</i>, I will
never forgive myself!”</p>

<p>She ran up the bank without heeding the
cobbler’s appeals.</p>

<p>“Stay, mademoiselle!” he cried after her;
“stay but a moment and listen! Ah, <i>Mère de
Dieu</i>, she rushes to her fate!”</p>

<p>He called to deaf ears; Rosaline fled through
the woods like a young fawn with the dog at
her heels. She took no thought of herself but
only remembered her grandmother and the
terrible prospect of a dragonnade at St. Cyr.
The custom of quartering dragoons on families
suspected of heresy was too fearfully frequent
for it to be improbable, and such visitations were
attended by horrible indignities; neither age
nor innocence was spared, and the end generally
saw the château in smoking ruins and the members
of the devoted family dead or banished.</p>

<p>All these things flashed through Rosaline’s
mind as she sped—on the wings of love—toward
her home, and no one could have overtaken
her. The poor hunchback followed as
best he could, cursing the fate that had forced
him to tell her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>At the gate of the château, Rosaline met
Babet, who tried to stop her, but in vain; the
girl ran across the garden and passed in through
the side door, which the housekeeper had left
open. All the while she wondered that the
place seemed so deserted and that she saw no
soldiers. She passed through the kitchen and
dining room, and running upstairs to her grandmother’s
sitting-room, flung open the door and
found herself face to face with M. de Baudri.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>M. DE BAUDRI’S TERMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosaline</span> did not look at M. de Baudri, but
beyond him into the room, and she saw her
grandmother’s armchair vacant, and the door
that led into the bedroom beyond stood open.
The girl’s heart seemed to stop beating, yet she
could not believe the evidence of her senses.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” she demanded of M. de
Baudri imperiously. “Where is Madame de St.
Cyr?”</p>

<p>He had greeted her with a profound bow and
he stood now before her, smiling and composed.</p>

<p>“Madame is on her way to Nîmes, mademoiselle,”
he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>“To Nîmes?” repeated Rosaline, with pale
lips. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what have you done?”</p>

<p>Her agitation did not ruffle his composure;
he still looked at her with a smile.</p>

<p>“I am afflicted to tell you such ill news,
mademoiselle,” he said suavely, “but unhappily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
a complaint has been lodged against
Madame de St. Cyr. She is accused of being
a heretic, and of sheltering a heretic. A charge
so serious must be investigated. Unfortunately,”
he concluded with a shrug, “I have
to do my duty.”</p>

<p>“Your duty!” repeated Rosaline, with sparkling
eyes. “Your duty, then, monsieur, is to
drag a helpless old woman from the shelter of
her home?”</p>

<p>He bit his lip and a red spot showed in either
cheek, but he controlled his own rising temper.</p>

<p>“Assuredly, mademoiselle,” he replied, “if
she is guilty of the detestable crime of heresy.”</p>

<p>“And you will be guilty of the crime of murder,
monsieur,” she retorted with a fierce indignation;
for the moment, she was perfectly
fearless. “Where is she? Where have you
taken her?” she cried.</p>

<p>He looked at the clock. “She must be in
Nîmes now, mademoiselle,” he replied courteously;
“she will be strictly confined there under
guard until she has been interrogated by the
authorities.”</p>

<p>Rosaline uttered a low cry of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she said, “it will kill her;
you know it will kill her!”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “I am not responsible,”
he said; “I am a soldier, bound to
execute the orders of my superiors. For her
sake, for yours, mademoiselle, I have endeavored
to alleviate the circumstances of her arrest,
and ’tis possible that—that there might be
a compromise.”</p>

<p>He paused, looking at her with a strange
expression.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri laid his hand on his heart.</p>

<p>“It rests with you, mademoiselle,” he said
with gallantry, “to determine madame’s fate.
There is no doubt that she is a heretic, and you
know the doom of heretics, but you may save
her yet.”</p>

<p>Rosaline drew her breath sharply; an intuition
warned her of what was coming. She was
white to the lips, but her blue eyes shone.</p>

<p>“Your meaning, monsieur?” she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“I stand high in the favor of M. Montrevel,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
he said placidly; “I am a good Catholic. It is
possible for me to obtain many concessions, if
I wish to do so. Mademoiselle understands
me; it is necessary for me to help her, and my
help can be obtained if Rosaline de St. Cyr
desires it.”</p>

<p>She stood looking at him in silence, and he
became at last a little uneasy under that
searching glance.</p>

<p>“You know that I love you, mademoiselle,”
he said; “if you consent now—this moment—to
marry me, I will save madame.”</p>

<p>He spoke with the air of one who contemplated
a virtuous deed.</p>

<p>“You wish me to marry you!” she exclaimed,
her voice quivering with passion. “M. de
Baudri, I too am a heretic.”</p>

<p>She turned on him the same face that she
had turned on the cobbler in the wood.</p>

<p>“Why do you not give me up to the authorities,
monsieur?” she went on defiantly; “you
are a soldier, do your duty!”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle does not understand that I
love her,” he retorted, unmoved. “Come, come,
Rosaline, you are young, you are misguided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
but you will be converted. Say the word;
promise to be my wife, and your grandmother
shall be saved, I pledge you my word.”</p>

<p>“Beware, monsieur!” Rosaline exclaimed
with scorn. “I have thought you a brave man,
but this is the act of a coward.”</p>

<p>His face reddened, and he suppressed the
violence of his own mood with difficulty.</p>

<p>“You forget,” he said slowly, “that you are
completely in my power. You are a heretic by
your own declaration, your grandmother is a
prisoner, and the precious steward, d’Aguesseau,
is also in my power.”</p>

<p>His keen eyes saw the swift change in her
face at d’Aguesseau’s name.</p>

<p>“M. d’Aguesseau?” she exclaimed, “is he
taken?”</p>

<p>There was an expression of satisfaction in the
keen blue eyes; he had touched her at last.</p>

<p>“This morning, mademoiselle,” he replied
coolly. “He is not only a heretic, but also
a rebel.”</p>

<p>She was controlling herself by a great effort.</p>

<p>“What will you do with him, monsieur?”
she asked faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Hang him, or send him to the galleys,” he
retorted calmly.</p>

<p>She reeled, catching at the back of a chair to
save herself from falling. M. de Baudri sprang
toward her to proffer his assistance, but she
motioned him away with a gesture of horror.</p>

<p>“Do not touch me!” she cried; “do not
touch me!”</p>

<p>She laid her head down on the back of the
chair, overcome with contending emotions. The
two she loved best in the world had been taken
from her.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried in a choking voice;
“what shall I do?”</p>

<p>The fiercest passions leaped up into M. de
Baudri’s eyes,—anger, jealousy, the desire for
revenge; he had suspected that there was some
secret between François and Rosaline, and now
he doubted it no longer.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is more afflicted at the capture
of a menial than at the arrest of her
own grandmother,” he remarked with a sneer.
“Doubtless she would like to arrange for his
liberation also.”</p>

<p>Rosaline made no reply; she was summoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
all her powers to meet this terrible
emergency.</p>

<p>“Even that is not beyond my power,” M. de
Baudri added coolly, “if mademoiselle desires
to purchase this—servant’s—liberty.”</p>

<p>Rosaline looked up with a haggard face, but
her eyes sparkled with anger.</p>

<p>“François d’Aguesseau is no servant,” she
cried; “he is as well born and far more noble
than his persecutor!”</p>

<p>The man laughed fiercely. “He is doubtless
mademoiselle’s lover,” he remarked contemptuously;
“she is more lightly won than I supposed.”</p>

<p>“It is always in the power of the strong to
insult the weak,” Rosaline retorted coldly.</p>

<p>“You cannot deny that this heretic is your
lover!” he exclaimed passionately.</p>

<p>Rosaline raised her head proudly; her innocent
gentleness had deserted her; she was
like a young lioness roused in defence of her
own.</p>

<p>“I do not deny it,” she said fearlessly; “M.
d’Aguesseau is my equal—and—and, yes,
monsieur, my affianced husband. I do not deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
it, nor do I deny my love for him, though he is
a prisoner and at your mercy; the <i>bon Dieu</i> defend
him and me!”</p>

<p>She had never looked more beautiful than at
that moment of passionate indignation and defiance
in the cause of those she loved. M. de
Baudri, looking at her, swore in his heart that he
would have her despite heaven and hell.</p>

<p>“You are frank, mademoiselle,” he remarked
coolly. “’Tis unusual for a young girl to be so
eager to declare her affection. I am afflicted
indeed; for ’tis my portion to decide M.
d’Aguesseau’s fate, and it would grieve me to
bereave mademoiselle of her lover!”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s distress was shaking her resolution;
already her lips were quivering, and there were
tears in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Is his fate in your hands, monsieur?” she
asked, with passionate anxiety and a desperate
hope.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri bowed, with his hand on his
heart.</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” he replied pleasantly; “he has
not yet been handed over to the authorities.
By lifting my finger I can set him free and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
your grandmother, and as easily I can consign
both to the miserable fate awaiting the heretics.”</p>

<p>Rosaline took a step forward, clasping her
hands and gazing intently into his face.</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur, surely you will be merciful,”
she exclaimed, “surely you will spare my grandmother—a
feeble woman—and M. d’Aguesseau—has
he not suffered enough? <i>Dieu!</i> he
has lost all,—his parents, his sister, his property.
I cannot believe that you will condemn these
two! You are a man, and not a fiend.”</p>

<p>He watched her with an inscrutable expression
on his face.</p>

<p>“And what will you do to regain their liberty?”
he asked slowly. “What petition do
you make for them?”</p>

<p>“I ask you in God’s name,” she said with
passionate earnestness, “and on my knees, monsieur,
though I never kneeled to living man
before.”</p>

<p>She was kneeling, her white face lifted, her
hands clasped; and with her golden hair she
looked more like a supplicating angel than an
unhappy and defenceless girl. For him it was
a moment of triumph; and his heart was untouched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
by any feeling of compulsion; it only
throbbed with fierce determination.</p>

<p>“Rise, mademoiselle,” he said, offering his
hand with gallantry. “Serious as the situation
is, dangerous as it is for me to release heretics,
yet I must be less than human to resist such eloquence
and beauty. Your petition is granted—on
one condition.”</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly, and her
heart sank as she read the expression in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“And that condition?” she demanded in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“A simple one, mademoiselle,” he said, with
an easy air of confidence: “I adore you, Rosaline;
and when you are my wife, these two are
free.”</p>

<p>“You say this to me after I have declared
my love for another man!” she exclaimed
aghast, “you say this to me,—a heretic! Your
conscience is not very scrupulous.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You are but a child, Rosaline,”
he said; “you will embrace my religion and
marry me, or—” he shrugged his shoulders,—“the
Tour de Constance for madame and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
gallows for your ex-lover. I give you a free
choice!”</p>

<p>Rosaline clasped her hands against her heaving
bosom, looking up, while the tears fell on
her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried; “forgive me for
kneeling to mortal man. I ought to have
known that there was no mercy save in Thee.
Alas, alas, my dear ones!”</p>

<p>There was a pause; she seemed to be absorbed
in her devotions, and M. de Baudri
watched her in silence but with relentless eyes.
Her beauty and her sorrow only intensified his
fierce passion.</p>

<p>“I see that you are willing to kill both rather
than sacrifice your whim,” he remarked, striking
a skilful blow at her tottering resolution.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that this is your fixed purpose?”
she cried. “Can it be that you would
have me save them thus? Have you no pride,
that you are willing to take a bride on such
terms as these? Have you no mercy?”</p>

<p>“I am showing much,” he replied suavely.
“How many men would spare a successful rival’s
neck?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“It will avail nothing,” she said passionately.
“I will appeal to M. de Bâville himself!”</p>

<p>He laughed heartlessly. “Do so, mademoiselle,”
he said, with a shrug, “and you will
have the pleasure of seeing your lover broken
on the wheel like his father.”</p>

<p>She gave a low cry of horror, hiding her face
in her hands. He walked over to the window
and looked out. The sun was setting behind
the valley of the Vaunage, and the wind was
already blowing the yellow leaves from the
trees and strewing the garden path with a
shower of gold. He knew that she was in the
throes of a mortal agony, and he did not dream
of relaxing the pressure until he broke her will.
He knew something of her character, and he
believed her capable of any sacrifice for those she
loved. He stood a while watching his orderly
leading his horse to and fro before the gate. He
had purposely deceived her on one point, and
he believed that he would succeed without violence,
but he intended to have her at any cost.
With her consent if he could, without it, if necessary,
he was not troubled with many scruples,
and her helpless anguish did not touch him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>He turned at last to find her sitting in her
grandmother’s chair, her face buried in her
hands, and her golden hair, escaping its bonds,
had fallen about her like a mantle.</p>

<p>“I am going back to Nîmes, mademoiselle,”
he said courteously, “and I regret that I have
to leave the house in the hands of guards, but
they are instructed to treat you with courtesy.
Permit me to recommend that you continue your
former prudent reserve in the matter of religion.
At ten to-morrow morning, I shall return for my
answer. You know the solitary condition, and
you hold two lives in your lovely hands.”</p>

<p>She looked up with ineffable scorn in her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu!</i> is this a man?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>A deep red flush mounted to his forehead,
but he bowed so profoundly that the curls of
his periwig fell before his face.</p>

<p>“It is your devoted lover, mademoiselle,” he
replied, and walked backward to the door, holding
his plumed hat against his heart and stepping
with the ease and precision of a dancing
master.</p>

<p>On the threshold he made her another profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
obeisance and, smiling, closed the door
behind him. He paused only a moment in the
hall below to give a few sharp instructions to
the sergeant left in command.</p>

<p>“If any man attempts to enter this house
to-night,” he said in a hard tone, “shoot him.
If you let him evade you, I will hang you.”</p>

<p>The soldier saluted, and M. de Baudri walked
calmly down the garden path, and leaping into
the saddle, set off at a gallop for Nîmes.</p>

<small>ROSALINE’S HUMBLE FRIENDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> a very different scene had been
enacted in the kitchen, where Babet had confronted
the cobbler and poured upon his devoted
head a volley of questions. She had gone out
with Rosaline early, before there was even a hint
of approaching catastrophe, and she could not
understand the swift march of events, and her
suspicious soul was possessed with a rooted distrust
of the poor hunchback, who had not yet
rallied from Rosaline’s accusations, striking
home as they did after the guilty hours of his
temptation. The two had shut themselves in
the kitchen with the dog, and le Bossu sat by
the fire, an expression of dull despair upon his
face, while Babet stood over him, her arms
akimbo and her keen black eyes riveted upon
him. Like Rosaline, she questioned his motive
for coming to the house at all.</p>

<p>“What brought you here this morning, Petit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Bossu?” she demanded harshly; “we needed
no new shoes.”</p>

<p>The cobbler’s face darkened. “<i>Nom de St.
Denis!</i>” he exclaimed; “have you nothing
better to do than to suspect your friends at such
a time?”</p>

<p>“Yet you came—and why?” persisted Babet.</p>

<p>The hunchback threw out his hands with a
gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“There is no reason why I should explain to
you,” he retorted contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Babet, in a tone of dark
suspicion, “what do you expect me to think
of such obstinate silence? You must be a
wicked man—I have always heard that hunchbacks
were malicious; how could you give
mademoiselle up? Why did you not let her
escape through the woods, beast?”</p>

<p>The cobbler was tried beyond endurance.</p>

<p>“Mother of Heaven!” he cried bitterly, “do
you think that I would injure a hair of mademoiselle’s
head? She could not escape; M. de
Baudri had two circles of sentries about the
place, and I knew it. There were men below
the cataract—in the woods—to attempt to pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
them would have been to risk her life. You
were in the snare; I tried to keep her away
from the house, but I could not, and they would
have found her anywhere in the end.”</p>

<p>Babet threw back her head with a snort; she
had the air of an old war-horse scenting the
battle from afar.</p>

<p>“You knew a great deal about it,” she remarked
maliciously; “couldn’t you warn us?”</p>

<p>He sighed; a weary resignation was settling
down on his heart. It seemed that no one
thought well of him, or expected good from
him.</p>

<p>“I knew nothing of it until this morning,” he
said coldly, “and then too late to help you. I
am lame, and M. de Baudri rides a fine horse.
Nevertheless, I got here five minutes before him—but
that was too late.”</p>

<p>His face and his voice began to convince even
Babet, and a faint pang of remorse smote her
heart, which, after all, was angered only on
Rosaline’s account. She left off questioning
him and walked to and fro in the kitchen, trying
to collect her thoughts, and the process was
much impeded by the even tramp of the sentry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
which sounded distinctly enough on the gravel
path outside the windows. Once or twice, when
the soldier’s back was turned, Babet shook her
fist at it, uttering threats in language that was
more fervent than pious.</p>

<p>“My poor lamb!” she muttered, her thoughts
returning to Rosaline, “what will she do in the
hands of this wolf? <i>Nom de Ciel!</i> if I could but
tear his throat!”</p>

<p>The hunchback did not heed her; he was
staring at the floor with vacant eyes. He meant
to save mademoiselle if he could, but how?
His lips moved now and then, and his brown
hands twitched nervously, but his ears were
straining to catch the slightest sound. Presently
Babet turned around, as if a sudden thought had
flashed upon her; she picked up the tongs from
beside the fire, and hiding them under her apron
walked deliberately out of the kitchen, slamming
the door behind her. The sound brought the
sentry at a run, and they met face to face.
Without a word, Babet lifted the tongs, and,
snapping them on to the brim of his hat, flung
it over the hedge.</p>

<p>“There, you varlet!” she exclaimed, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the tongs close to the end of his nose, “learn to
take off your hat to a decent woman, who’s
old enough to be your mother, and stop staring
in the window with those goggle eyes of
yours. I’m no jail-bird, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Mother!” ejaculated the astonished dragoon,
“you old gray cat! <i>Dame!</i> if I do not
wring your neck for your impudence when M.
le Capitaine has gone.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” retorted Babet, grimly, “you’ll
find it tough, <i>mon fils</i>. Your hat is in the briar
bush, my lad;” and she walked back into the
house with a grim smile of triumph, leaving
the soldier cursing her while he searched for
his hat.</p>

<p>Babet did not return to the kitchen; she proceeded
up the stairs to the room where Rosaline
was talking to M. de Baudri. The door was
closed; but refined scruples were not among
the good housekeeper’s faults, and she calmly
applied her ear to the keyhole, all the while
clasping the tongs fiercely under her apron;
and for the next twenty minutes her face was
a picture. More than once she had her hand
on the latch, but prudence finally prevailed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
three minutes before M. de Baudri emerged, she
made her way cautiously back to the kitchen.
She had heard enough to understand the whole,
and she descended upon the cobbler like an
avalanche, carrying all before her. In the
storm of her indignation she could not remain
silent, and she poured out the whole story of
M. de Baudri’s shameless persecution of his
prisoner. Le Bossu had long ago learned the
lesson of self-control, and he listened with composure,
though his face seemed to have aged
since the morning.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried Babet, regardless now of
the sentry’s stare, “he would force that white
dove to marry him! That villain de Baudri—may
the <i>bon Dieu</i> blast him as the great chestnut-tree
yonder was blasted with lightning! He—the
rogue—would make mademoiselle sell
herself to him to save old madame and her
lover. Woe is me, why did that man d’Aguesseau
ever come here?”</p>

<p>The hunchback looked up, surprise in his dull
eyes.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded, “save
her lover? Her lover is safe in the Cévennes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“Much you know!” retorted the woman,
scornfully; “it seems that he was captured this
morning.”</p>

<p>The cobbler was silent a moment, thinking
deeply.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“You think it a lie of that devil’s?” asked
Babet, eagerly.</p>

<p>He nodded. “M. de Baudri is doing it to
force her to yield,” he said slowly; “he has
sworn to marry her. I do not believe that
he has taken one Huguenot prisoner to-day,
save—” he stopped, and looked out of the
window at the sentry, who kept staring in with
a furious face.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu</i>, what a fiend!” exclaimed Babet,
thrusting her tongs into the fire, where they
would heat, after casting a vicious glance toward
the window. “He has given mademoiselle until
to-morrow morning to decide,” she added.</p>

<p>“What will she do?” the cobbler asked in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>“Do? oh, I know her!” the woman retorted
with a snort; “to save those two she would
die. She’ll marry him unless—” Babet thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the tongs deeper in the coals, “unless I wring
his neck!”</p>

<p>“That cannot be done,” remarked le Bossu,
soberly, “but something must be done to-night.”</p>

<p>“What?” snapped his companion, “what can
a hunchback and an old woman do? A pretty
pair of birds for such an emergency. Leer away,
young man; I have the tongs ready for you!”
she added in an aside, her fierce eyes on the
window.</p>

<p>“Has she one true friend with influence in
Nîmes?” the cobbler asked.</p>

<p>Babet shook her head, and then, after a moment’s
thought,—</p>

<p>“There is Père Ambroise,” she said.</p>

<p>Le Bossu’s face brightened. “Good!” he
said, “the priest can do much; and now, I am a
Catholic, Babet, but as there is a God in heaven,
I mean no harm! Is there any boy or man who
could carry a message amongst the Camisards?”</p>

<p>Babet had grown reckless in her misery over
mademoiselle; she did not hesitate to reply.</p>

<p>“There is the blacksmith’s boy at St.
Césaire,” she said, “a good child, and active
as a wild hare. What do you want of him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“If possible, I must find M. d’Aguesseau,”
he replied, “and also Père Ambroise; I cannot
do both without help.”</p>

<p>“And if M. d’Aguesseau is in prison,” suggested
Babet, grimly.</p>

<p>“The will of Heaven be done,” replied the
cobbler, calmly, “but Père Ambroise shall be
here before dawn,” and he rose as he spoke.</p>

<p>“How will you get out?” asked the woman,
eying him curiously.</p>

<p>“You will see,” he rejoined, and quietly
gathering up his bag of tools, he left the kitchen
and walked through the hall.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri had just left by the front way,
and the cobbler went out at the back of the
house. There was a high row of box beside the
path, and dropping on his hands and knees he
crept along behind it, past the sentry on that
side. He had to move very slowly and softly,
avoiding every dry twig and even the dead leaves,
but he reached the outer hedge at last. Here
there was a hole, through which Truffe passed in
and out. The cobbler thrust his bag through
and then followed it; his face and hands were
scratched, but what of that? He rose from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
knees in the open road, and, shaking off the
dust, shouldered his load and walked on, limping
more painfully than usual. He had to pass one
guard, but this man did not know that he had
been in the house and saw nothing unusual in
the appearance of the little cobbler of St.
Antoine.</p>

<p>“You are late, le Bossu,” he said good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“The shoes fit too well,” retorted the hunchback,
coolly, “and my patron is rich.”</p>

<p>“<i>Pardieu!</i>” the soldier exclaimed with a
laugh. “I will borrow to-morrow morning. We
have a bag of heretics here.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mère de Dieu</i>, burn them,—all but the
shoes!” said le Bossu, and walked calmly on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>“MORTIS PORTIS FRACTIS”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was daybreak; the pale sky was luminous,
and the golden east throbbed with the approaching
glory. Already the hill-tops were radiant,
but the low country lay in the shadow, and a
white mist floated over the valleys. The air
was full of the twittering of birds, and all the life
in Nature began to stir. There were no travellers
on the highroad so early, save one, a corpulent
priest, mounted on a stout mule, proceeding
toward St. Cyr. Père Ambroise detested extraordinary
exertion, but he had yielded to the importunities
of the cobbler. For his own part,
he thought that ten o’clock was soon enough to
deal with M. de Baudri, but he had roused himself
and set out at an unearthly hour because of
le Bossu’s representations. No man could
regret the trouble at the château de St. Cyr
more sincerely than he did; he had labored to
protect these two defenceless women, and he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
no profit in madame’s arrest. Père Ambroise
would never be numbered with the persecutors;
he cared more for a bottle of good wine from
the vintage of the Vaunage than he did for the
arrest of a score of heretics. Besides, he had
no real love for M. de Baudri, and he foresaw
M. de Baudri’s triumph. Père Ambroise wanted
to convert Rosaline; he wanted to see her either
in a convent or wedded to a good son of the
Church, but he could not digest the prospect of
this particular bridegroom. He had not the
smallest respect for Rosaline’s religious convictions
or scruples; it was impossible for him to
regard them with anything but contempt or
hatred, but he really cared for the girl’s welfare.
He had known her from a child, and he felt a
sincere affection for her. For her sake he had
spared Madame de St. Cyr, and he had no
desire now to give her pain. He rode along,
therefore, revolving all these matters in his mind,
and wondering how far he could trespass on
the patience and friendship of the Intendant of
Languedoc,—the only man who could take M.
de Baudri in hand. The result of Père Ambroise’s
ruminations was not satisfactory; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
advanced at a leisurely pace, for his mule was
nearly as stout as he was, and the sun rose in
all its splendor as he approached St. Cyr. He
disliked effort and excitement, and he could
devise no easy and comfortable way out of the
dilemma. After all, perhaps she would have to
marry M. de Baudri; at least, that ought to
bring her into the church, and if she remained a
heretic? Well, Père Ambroise reflected with a
broad smile, that alternative would furnish him
with a rod to hold over the stubborn head of
M. le Capitaine. The good father’s fat sides
shook a little with silent laughter as he drew
rein at the gate of the château. <i>Âme de St.
Denis!</i> he would make M. de Baudri dance to
a pretty tune before the Intendant; there were
compensations, no matter what the result.</p>

<p>The sentry—the same young man who had
been disciplined by Babet—received the priest
with respect; his instructions had not mentioned
Père Ambroise, and the stout, black-robed figure
ambled placidly up the gravel path and entered
by way of the kitchen. This was empty, for
Babet had deserted her fortress for the moment
to wait on her young mistress. The priest proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
through the house and was greeted at
the stairs by Truffe, who knew him. He
climbed up in a leisurely way, panting at each
step, and, entering the sitting-room, found Rosaline
and her faithful attendant. The young girl
hailed his entrance with relief and hope, and
something like life came back into her white
face.</p>

<p>Père Ambroise was touched by her evident
confidence in his good-will, and seating himself
comfortably, he dismissed Babet with a placid
air of authority that sent her fuming to the
kitchen, where she resumed her task of heating
the fire-irons. She was determined not to be
taken unawares, and the sentry—perfectly acquainted
with her occupation—kept his distance
and bided his time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in response to a few well-directed
questions, Rosaline told her story, which was
substantially the same as the one already recited
by le Bossu. A man less keen than Père
Ambroise would have detected her resolution
in her manner, and he was not unprepared for
her answer when he asked her what she intended
to do. She was standing in front of him, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
hands clasped loosely before her, and her head
erect, but her face was like marble, white and
still.</p>

<p>“I have no choice, <i>mon père</i>,” she said, in a
low voice; “no one cares for a heretic. It is
my duty to save my grandmother. I cannot let
her die for my happiness! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> what a
monster I should be! I must consent to M. de
Baudri’s terms, and then—” she paused, drawing
a deep breath and her clear blue eyes looked
out, away toward the grim mountains of the
north, “and then I know that the <i>bon Dieu</i> will
release me. He will send me death—sweet
death—for my bridegroom!”</p>

<p>Père Ambroise regarded her thoughtfully.
For his times, he was a liberal man, and he
did not immediately foresee hell fires. He
saw only a pure and defenceless girl, and his
heart smote him.</p>

<p>“The <i>bon Dieu</i> is offended with you for
heresy, Rosaline,” he remarked calmly; “that
is the cause of your misfortunes.”</p>

<p>Rosaline looked at him searchingly; she had
long ago weighed Père Ambroise and found
him wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“He is my Judge,” she replied, and closed
her lips firmly.</p>

<p>It was not the hour for religious controversy,
and the priest knew it; he pursed up his lips
and was silent. But she had a purpose at
heart, and not even his frowns discouraged it.</p>

<p>“Père Ambroise,” she said, “I want to go
into Nîmes now—at once—to see my grandmother.
I will consent to nothing until I do—you
can get this favor for me—I ask nothing
else, but oh, do this for me!”</p>

<p>Père Ambroise had been considering many
things, and he was not unwilling to listen to so
reasonable a desire. Indeed, he had been thinking
with some pity of poor old Madame de St.
Cyr.</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” he said, “but not until M.
de Baudri comes; I have no authority, but he
cannot refuse this at my request.”</p>

<p>Rosaline thanked him without emotion; the
girl’s passionate grief and rebellion had spent
itself in a night of agony; she had reached the
dead level of despair. She still believed her
lover to be a prisoner, for Babet had been too
wise to hold out uncertain hopes, and Rosaline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
had made up her mind to sacrifice herself for
her two loved ones, and the sacrifice she contemplated
was worse to her than death. No
victim was ever prepared to be laid on the
altar with a greater vigil of misery. She would
have died gladly, but this was far more terrible
and more degrading. She was in a stupor of
misery, but yet too wise to expect relief from
Père Ambroise. His point of view and hers
were sundered as widely as the poles. To
him it was only an undesirable step toward
her conversion, and a certain way of saving her
life.</p>

<p>It was early, and the placid father left the
victim to her reflections and, proceeding to
the pantry, foraged with some comfort. He
was too intimately acquainted with Babet’s peculiarities
to approach her at such a moment
with a demand for breakfast, but he managed to
comfort the inner man with the remains of a
cold chicken pasty and a salad, and some more
diligent search unearthed a small bottle of <i>eau-de-vie</i>,
so that he emerged from his seclusion, at
last, wiping his lips and with an air of satisfaction.
After this, he mounted his spectacles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
searched Madame de St. Cyr’s little library for
heretical books, but the old gentlewoman had
been too cautious to be so easily betrayed, and
he found nothing of interest.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that when M. de Baudri
arrived at ten o’clock he found Père Ambroise
in possession, and fell to cursing his luck, knowing
well enough that the priest had both the
will and the power to hamper his designs. He
held the corpulent father in supreme contempt,
but he dared not insult him at a time when the
priests were supreme, nor could he drive Rosaline
to extremities while she had such a respectable
protector. M. de Baudri was a keen man,
and he saw that a few concessions might gain
an ally, while insolence would make an undesirable
enemy. There was no hope of his marrying
Rosaline if Père Ambroise chose to declare
her a heretic and have her shut up in a convent.
The priest held the winning card and knew it,
and it took him only half an hour to arrange
that the young girl should accompany him to
see her grandmother, under the escort of M. de
Baudri and his dragoons.</p>

<p>Before eleven, therefore, they were on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
road to Nîmes. A carriage had been obtained
at St. Césaire, and the priest, Rosaline, and
Babet sat within it, while M. de Baudri rode
beside it and a guard of dragoons followed at a
short distance. Rosaline felt herself to be on
the way to an open grave, and she leaned back
in her corner with closed eyes. No one spoke,
and the drive was taken in silence. Finally
they passed through the Porte de France and
then proceeded more slowly through the streets.
The noises of the city aroused the poor girl a
little, and she looked out, only to shrink again
from the curious stare of the crowd. On the
carriage went, turning at last into a long street
and then stopping at the door of the common
jail. Happily for Rosaline, she did not recognize
it, though she shuddered as she passed
under the grim portal with Père Ambroise.
They were alone, the others remaining without,
and they were admitted with but little parley.
Like a somnambulist, the girl passed through a
gloomy corridor and saw the jailer unfastening
the bolts of a strong door. The man threw it
open and stood back, and Rosaline did not heed
his remark to the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“You are just in time, <i>mon père</i>,” he said,
with a brutal laugh.</p>

<p>They stood at the entrance of a narrow cell
lighted by one small window, and on the
wretched pallet lay the motionless form of
Madame de St. Cyr. At the sight of her grandmother’s
face Rosaline awoke from her dream
and running forward, fell on her knees beside
her with a cry of surprise and anguish. Père
Ambroise hastily closed the door behind him;
he did not need to look a second time to see
that M. de Baudri was to be defrauded of one
victim.</p>

<p>“Speak to me, <i>grand’mère</i>,” Rosaline cried
pitifully. “Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, why did I ask for
one night to decide? Twelve hours ago I
might have saved her!”</p>

<p>The sound of a beloved voice often rouses
even the dying; Madame de St. Cyr stirred and
opened her eyes. They dwelt lovingly on the
girl for a moment, and then memory returned
and an expression of horror came into her face.</p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!” she gasped, rallying her
forces. “Are you here, my darling?—now is
death bitter indeed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“She is safe,” Père Ambroise interposed, his
heart touched at last; “I will protect her.”</p>

<p>The old woman gave him a look of ineffable
gratitude; she was almost beyond speech, but
she laid one hand feebly on Rosaline’s head, and
her lips moved as she blessed her.</p>

<p>“Thank the <i>bon Dieu</i>,” she murmured faintly,
“the old tree was cut—down—and the flower—spared!
Weep not, my child. Beyond—there
is peace.”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s slender frame was shaken with
agony.</p>

<p>“Live for me, <i>grand’mère</i>!” she cried; “now
indeed am I desolate—and I would have saved
you!”</p>

<p>But the end was too near for the dying
woman to understand; she sank back with closed
eyes and Père Ambroise began to recite the
prayer for the dying. In his emotion he forgot
that she was a heretic. Rosaline clung to her
in an agony of grief and self-abnegation.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me save you!” she cried; “live that
I may die for you!”</p>

<p>Madame opened her eyes, there was a placid
smile on her face, she had forgotten all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
terror and the pain, prison walls held her no
more.</p>

<p>“There is no anguish,” she said softly, looking
away into space, “only light—my husband—my
son—the <i>bon Dieu</i> be praised—there
shall be peace!”</p>

<p>She spoke no more; there was no sound but
Père Ambroise’s Latin and Rosaline’s weeping.
The dying woman lay still, and the clear eyes
still looked triumphantly beyond this world’s
agony, and almost without a sigh the gentle
soul escaped from prison. Death, the Deliverer,
opened the gates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE COBBLER’S FAITH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Père Ambroise</span> was plentifully supplied with
this world’s goods, and he had a house of his
own in Nîmes, not a hundred yards from the
Esplanade, where he lived in comfort and security,
with no fear of the Camisard raids. To
the right of the door of this house was a comfortable
room, furnished with many luxuries:
soft rugs, deep arm-chairs, tapestry-hangings, a
huge fireplace, where the logs burned cheerfully
on the great andirons. And here Père Ambroise
sat entertaining M. de Baudri over a
bottle of rare wine, on the evening of that eventful
day. They had both dined well, and the
good father’s rubicund face wore an expression
of satisfaction, while his guest was visibly discontented.
The fact was that Père Ambroise
was in command of the situation, and he had
forced the soldier to yield at all points. At that
moment Rosaline was secure in one of his
upper rooms, and he was in a position to dictate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
his own terms. If he chose he could declare
her a heretic and immure her in a convent for
life; M. de Baudri’s only chances of being a
bridegroom lay in his ability to propitiate the
priest. Nothing could have been more distasteful
to the soldier than this unexpected turn of
affairs; he was accustomed to command and
not to sue, and now he was forced to persuade a
man who disliked him to look at things from
his point of view. He cursed his luck in secret,
and tried to smile over his wine; never had he
been more neatly balked in his purposes—nor
by a more contemptible enemy. Meanwhile
Père Ambroise leaned back in his chair and
regarded him from between his half-closed
lids, mightily diverted by the other’s discomfiture,
and not yet entirely decided on his own
course. He was not sure that it would be a
merciful thing to shut Rosaline up in a convent
for life, and Père Ambroise was one of those
men who cannot be ill-natured after a good
dinner. He raised his wine-glass in his fat
fingers and held it before the candle that he
might admire the delicate amber color of the
wine before he drank it, and all his movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
were deliberate and comfortable. His placidity
goaded M. de Baudri to the verge of murder.</p>

<p>“You cannot marry a heretic, my son,” Père
Ambroise remarked pleasantly; “therefore you
must either allow her to go to her fate—which,
by the way, is of your preparing—or wait until
she is converted.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i> do you take me for a fool?” exclaimed
his companion. “How long have you
been at this hopeful business of conversion?”</p>

<p>“Only since I have known her to be a heretic,”
the priest replied composedly.</p>

<p>“<i>Sacristi!</i> convert a heretic!” de Baudri
laughed; “how many are ever converted?”</p>

<p>“Large numbers—in some circumstances,”
Père Ambroise said, with a broad smile; “’tis
said that Du Chayla had a basement full of converts
when their misguided friends arose and
murdered him at Pont-de-Montvert; a poor requital
for his zeal, monsieur. As for myself,”—he
waved his fat hands,—“I am a man of peace,
and I have ever labored to save these misguided
people from violence.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri was leaning his elbow on the
table, staring gloomily at the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“<i>Mère de Dieu!</i>” he said bitterly; “they are
all only fit for hanging.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would prefer to hang mademoiselle,”
his companion remarked, refilling his
glass cautiously, for he did not wish to disturb
his brain with the fumes of liquor.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri looked at him darkly.</p>

<p>“I do her great honor in offering to marry
her,” he said harshly.</p>

<p>Père Ambroise nodded his head approvingly,
and took a sip of wine.</p>

<p>“Assuredly,” he said; “so great an honor
that I am inclined to prevent you. A true son
of the Church should not wed a heretic. The
proper destination for her is a convent.”</p>

<p>The younger man swore under his breath.</p>

<p>“You old fox, you,” he exclaimed, “you do
not want me to marry the girl—I believe you
want her yourself!”</p>

<p>Père Ambroise turned his eyes piously toward
heaven.</p>

<p>“The saints forbid!” he murmured. “You
have an unbridled tongue, <i>mon fils</i>, and deserve
discipline for offering an insult to one in holy
orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The officer laughed. “<i>Dame</i>, you old
rogue!” he said, “do you fat fathers take us for
fools? Hark!” he added sharply, pausing to
listen, “what is that? I heard the dog bark.”</p>

<p>“Rosaline’s poodle,” replied the priest, undisturbed.</p>

<p>M. de Baudri was suspicious. “Have you
got her secure?” he demanded imperiously.</p>

<p>“Absolutely secure,” retorted his companion,
indifferently; “my servants are faithful, and her
door is fastened by an oaken bar too strong for
two women to force. Compose yourself, <i>mon
fils</i>; you consented to this respite; she was to
have until eight to-morrow morning for reflection,
and she has reason enough to make good
use of the time. Her grandmother is dead and
she has no defender but me. She will not resist
my authority, but you take a strange way to
propitiate me and obtain my good offices.”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri gnawed his lip with a lowering
expression on his face.</p>

<p>“I shall have to come to your terms, I suppose,
<i>mon père</i>,” he said at last with an effort to
appear congenial.</p>

<p>“That is more to the point,” Père Ambroise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
remarked pleasantly, and leaned over to fill his
guest’s glass again.</p>

<p>While these two worthies talked and drank, a
very different scene was being enacted in the
second story of the house. Here, in a large
back room, Rosaline and Babet were confined;
the woman sitting stiffly upright in a chair by
the table, where the candles were set, while
Rosaline had thrown herself face downward on
the bed, in a silent agony of grief and despair.
Between the two was the black poodle Truffe,
her ears pointed, silent and watchful after the
fashion of dogs in new places.</p>

<p>Babet ventured upon no consolation; she
stared grimly before her with unwinking eyes.
She was thinking of her own fate; there was no
one to interpose for her, and her destiny was
probably the Tour de Constance. She tried to
recall all she had heard of this fearful prison
at Aiguemortes, of the malarious swamps about
it, of the smells that arose at low tide, of the
hideous cruelties practised in its loathsome
dungeons, of the sick and dying, whose bodies
were denied decent burial. Grim and strong as
old Babet was, her cheek blanched at the thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
and, for the moment, she forgot even her ewe-lamb.
(The most unselfish soul must fight its
own battle sometime, to the exclusion of all
else.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rosaline lay there with her face
hidden on her arms; her grandmother’s death
had bereaved her of one who might have remained
with her, helping her to endure her lot,
for she hoped for no release; she must purchase
her lover’s liberty and life at the expense
of her own happiness. M. de Baudri had taken
care to remind her that he still held the fate
of François d’Aguesseau in his hand, and she
knew that the sacrifice must still be made. If
François divined it, he would refuse his life at
such a cost,—that she knew; but he would
never know, he might even think her false and
lightly won! But all these things were small
compared with the alternative; it was not for
her to send him to the gallows, or worse, to
make him a galley slave, that she might escape
M. de Baudri. Again she shuddered at the
thought of her fate; the lowest dungeons of the
Tour de Constance would be heaven compared
with such a marriage! She shrank from it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
all pure women shrink from any marriage that
is not founded on the highest and purest
motives. Her very flesh rebelled against her
spirit, and she lay there shivering, like one
stricken with ague. Yet strong is love; she
must save him, and then, oh, she prayed the
<i>bon Dieu</i> to release her!</p>

<p>In spite of all this misery, time passed. The
house was quiet, no sounds came from below,
and practical Babet began to wonder what time
it was. There was no clock in the room, and
she could not conjecture the hour; it seemed
as if they had been there an age. Just at this
moment she heard some one lift the bar outside
the door, and Truffe barked. Babet
pounced upon her, muffled her head in her
petticoat, and then she listened intently. The
visitor could not enter, for she had secured
the door within. There was a soft knock on
the panels, and Rosaline rose with a white face,
and stood waiting. The knock was repeated,
and some one spoke their names very low. The
voice seemed familiar, and the young girl went
to the door and listened again.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de St. Cyr,” the visitor whispered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
“open the door—’tis I, Charlot the
cobbler.”</p>

<p>Babet uttered an exclamation, and Rosaline
unfastened the lock and admitted the hunchback.
He looked old and worn, and carried
his green bag, and he paused just inside the
door, looking from one to the other, as if he
doubted his reception.</p>

<p>“Why have you come, Charlot?” Rosaline
asked sadly.</p>

<p>“I have come to help you to get away,
mademoiselle,” he replied simply, hurt past
reason by their indifference, but bearing it, as
he bore all things, as a part of his lot.</p>

<p>Rosaline shook her head. “I cannot go,”
she said, “but Babet—you will save Babet,
Charlot.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ciel!</i>” ejaculated that woman sharply, “he
will save me, will he? And what do you
propose to do?”</p>

<p>The young girl did not heed her, nor did the
cobbler.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, “your grandmother
is dead, and M. d’Aguesseau was
never captured.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Rosaline stood looking at him with parted
lips, her whole form quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she said, “was it a lie?”</p>

<p>“It was,” replied the cobbler quietly; “I have
sent a message to him, he is with Cavalier.”</p>

<p>She could not believe him. “Alas!” she
said, “you do this to get me away.”</p>

<p>The cobbler knelt down at her feet.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, looking earnestly
into her face, “I swear by all I hold most
sacred, that I do not deceive you. M. d’Aguesseau
is at liberty, though M. de Baudri offers a
hundred crowns for his head.”</p>

<p>Her strength failed her, she sank on the
nearest chair, covering her face with her hands.
The reaction was too great for resistance; it
seemed as if her heart would stop beating, and
the room whirled about her. He was safe, and
she was not required to make the sacrifice!</p>

<p>The effect on Babet was very different; she
released Truffe and began to gather up their
scattered belongings.</p>

<p>“How can we get out, Petit Bossu?” she
demanded grimly,—“in your shoe-bag?”</p>

<p>“The servants are feasting in the kitchen,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the cobbler said. “Père Ambroise and M. de
Baudri are drinking below, and the stairs are
not two yards from this door. We must trust
in the <i>bon Dieu</i>.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he opened his bag and took out
two long cloaks and hoods similar to those worn
by an order of Sisters of Charity at Nîmes.</p>

<p>“Thou hast the mind of a great general,
Charlot,” remarked Babet, with a queer smile;
“the hump is a pity.”</p>

<p>Rosaline roused herself and looked at the
disguise.</p>

<p>“Alas! where can we go, Charlot?” she
asked sadly; “how can we escape them?”</p>

<p>“To-night you can go to my shop, mademoiselle,”
he replied, quietly, “and to-morrow, as
soon as the gates are open, you can start out to
St. Césaire. I have arranged with the blacksmith’s
wife to hide you until I can guide you
to—to a place of safety.”</p>

<p>“It may be done,” Rosaline said, after a moment’s
thought. “I was to have till eight to-morrow;
there is one hope in a thousand—but
the risk to you, Charlot!”</p>

<p>The little hunchback smiled. “Mademoiselle,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
he said quietly, “I am scarcely worth
killing.”</p>

<p>The tears shone in her blue eyes, but she said
nothing, partly because Babet was hurriedly
muffling her in the cloak and hood.</p>

<p>A few moments later they emerged from the
room, Babet carrying Truffle under her mantle;
Charlot secured the door behind them, replacing
the bar, and softly and cautiously they descended.
They heard Père Ambroise speaking,
in unctuous tones, and a coarse oath from M.
de Baudri, on whom the wine was having some
effect, but no one heard them. The porter had
left his place and the door was unbolted. Almost
without noise, the three slipped out and
stood free upon the open street.</p>

<small>IN THE WOODS OF ST. CYR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning found Charlot in his shop.
He had spread his tools and leather on his bench
with a pretence of work, but he was not working.
He sat watching his door with eager eyes, alert
and impatient. He was waiting for the return
of the blacksmith’s boy whom he had sent in
search of d’Aguesseau. Rosaline and Babet
had walked out of the gate of the town as soon
as it was opened, and must be now near St.
Césaire. In le Bossu’s chamber a candle burned
before the Virgin, a prayer for the heretics; such
is the inconsistency of the human heart and its
religion.</p>

<p>In a week the little hunchback had grown old,
and his back seemed more pitifully bowed than
ever. The Intendant of Languedoc might indeed
regard him as scarcely worth the killing;
but no man can see the naked soul of his brother,
and it may be vastly different from his body; as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
different as the abode on earth is from the mansion
in heaven. “It is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power.” It is cast in the shape of a
cripple on earth, it is raised in the form of an
angel. The starved soul of le Bossu looked out
of his patient eyes and saw not even a crumb of
comfort falling from the rich man’s table, and
self-sacrifice became the law of his life.</p>

<p>He looked down at his brown, toil-worn, right
hand, and tears shone in his eyes. It was sanctified,
for she had kissed it. He shrank within
himself at the thought, but in her gratitude and
her relief, she had thanked him and she had even
taken his hand and kissed it. Had he not delivered
her from a fate worse than death? and
was he not her humble friend and servant?
Rosaline’s impulse had been followed by no
second thought; her whole soul was filled with
the hope of escaping to her lover. And the poor
little cobbler understood her, but he felt that he
might fall down and worship her still. No one
else had ever considered him, no one else had
ever been uniformly kind to him; in the parched
desert of his life she alone had held him a cup of
water. The starved and empty heart held one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
image; the life—of so little worth—was at her
service.</p>

<p>The sun was high enough now to reach the
court, and the spot of light on the pavement began
to grow, but the weed that had blossomed
in June had gone to seed and stood there yellow
and lean. One of the children opposite was ill
of a fever, and the other played silently, in a
melancholy way, on the steps. Le Bossu’s
glance lighted on her and his heart was touched;
it was cruel that a heart so large in its sympathy
for all sufferers should have been cast by the
wayside and choked with thorns. He rose from
his bench and took up a little pair of shoes, and
then he opened his wallet and counted out some
money; with the shoes and the coin he crossed
the court and gave them to the little girl for her
sick sister. The child stared at him wide-eyed;
she had shown him as little mercy as the others,
and had looked upon the hunchback as unlike
other human beings. She had not the sense to
thank him, though she clasped his presents
greedily to her breast and fled into the house,
half-affrighted at the little man with his hump.
The unwitting cruelty of children often hurts as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
much as the coarse brutality of their parents,
but to-day le Bossu smiled. If his life was
worth something to Rosaline de St. Cyr, it was
worth all the suffering of living it; the <i>bon Dieu</i>
had given him a blessed compensation.</p>

<p>He was returning to the shop of Two Shoes
when another man entered the court. The cobbler
looked about anxiously, for he had been
dreading the possible appearance of Père Ambroise
or one of M. de Baudri’s emissaries, but
a second glance reassured him, for he came face
to face with François d’Aguesseau. The hunchback
signed to him to follow him in to his shop
and then closed the door.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” demanded d’Aguesseau, in
an agitated tone. “I received your message,
and I am here.”</p>

<p>The cobbler looked at him strangely. “Did
you come to release mademoiselle single-handed?”
he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“I came to save her—if mortal man can do
it,” he retorted sternly. “It may be that they
will take me in exchange; I hear that there is
a price on my head—but, <i>mon Dieu!</i> where
is she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>His face was haggard and his dress much disordered.
It was evident that he had not paused
for either rest or food.</p>

<p>“She is at St. Césaire, I trust,” the cobbler
replied calmly; “she and Babet got away from
Père Ambroise’s house last night and started
this morning in disguise for St. Césaire.”</p>

<p>He made no mention of his share in the
deliverance, and François jumped to another
conclusion.</p>

<p>“Faithful Babet!” he exclaimed joyfully;
“doubtless she planned it all. I will follow
them at once.”</p>

<p>“You must meet them at the appointed spot,
not elsewhere,” said the cobbler. “I was to
meet them between the bridge and the cataract,
at the spot where the old mulberry stands. Do
you recall it?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” replied d’Aguesseau, “but why
there?”</p>

<p>“Because they are to hide at St. Césaire until
afternoon; then, if there is no pursuit to St. Cyr,
they can start without being observed. If the
château is too closely guarded, they will wait
until night,” he added; “but it will not be, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
no one will think of their return to the close
vicinity of danger; it is Nîmes that will be
searched for them.”</p>

<p>“But why can I not go straight to them now?”
François demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>The cobbler sighed. “Monsieur,” he said
patiently, “every house, every cottage is
watched, and if you are recognized—”</p>

<p>He broke off with an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>“I see,” d’Aguesseau replied; “you are a
wise man, Petit Bossu. Tell me about Madame
de St. Cyr.”</p>

<p>“She died yesterday in the jail here,” the
hunchback answered; “the shock of the arrest
and mademoiselle’s danger ended her life.”</p>

<p>D’Aguesseau clenched his hand. “<i>Mon
Dieu!</i>” he exclaimed, “how long wilt Thou
afflict us?—how long?”</p>

<p>“It was best so,” the cobbler remarked quietly.
“If she had lived, Mademoiselle Rosaline would
have sacrificed herself to save her. She believed
that you and her grandmother were both captives;
M. de Baudri told her so, and promised
to save your lives—to release you both only
on the condition that she should marry him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“The accursed villain!” broke out François,
laying his hand on his sword: “may I be spared
to chastise him!”</p>

<p>He walked to and fro in the little room in
suppressed fury; all the fierce impulses of a bold
and daring nature were aroused.</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu!</i>” he exclaimed, in a low tone, “I
cannot go to England for Cavalier; I must stay
and fight this monster!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” remarked le Bossu, gravely, “you
must save Mademoiselle de St. Cyr.”</p>

<p>François came to himself. “I ought not to
need you to remind me,” he said. “I will go
at once to the appointed place and wait; it is
not long now, but, in the meantime, is she
safe?”</p>

<p>“We can only trust in Providence,” replied
the cobbler, “since to approach her would increase
her risks. But—pardon me, monsieur—if
you stay much longer in Nîmes, you will
be arrested.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” he replied; “I thought only of
her when I came, but I must get away now for
her sake. Charlot, I thank you,” he said, holding
out his hand; “I do not know why you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
should do so much for us who are, in your eyes,
heretics and criminals.”</p>

<p>The hunchback smiled as he returned the
pressure of d’Aguesseau’s hand.</p>

<p>“Life is a mystery,” he rejoined, with a new
dignity that became him well, “and so is death.”</p>

<p>He went with François down the Rue St.
Antoine and stood at the gate watching him
until his figure disappeared on the long white
road. Later le Bossu would go himself to keep
the appointment, for he too had an errand
there; nor could he rest until he knew that
mademoiselle was safely out of the neighborhood
of Nîmes. But there was time yet, and he
wanted to know what Père Ambroise intended
to do, and where M. de Baudri would next cast
his net.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, out at St. Césaire, Babet and
Rosaline were safely hidden in the blacksmith’s
house. It was a little cottage on the outskirts
of the village, and from the rear the inmates
could easily reach the woods about St. Cyr.
The smith had been a faithful though humble
friend to the family at the château, and like
many others, he was a concealed Huguenot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
He and his wife therefore gladly ministered to
Rosaline’s comfort and set a simple dinner of
<i>pot-au-feu</i> before their two guests. Babet and
Truffe did ample justice to the meal, but Rosaline
could not eat, in spite of Babet’s remonstrances.
The young girl was frantic to be off,
to fly to her lover, that they might seek safety
together; and she had not the older woman’s
prudence, who felt that another dinner might
be a long way off, and who did not believe profoundly
in the culinary accomplishments of the
Cévenols.</p>

<p>The hour came at last, and bidding her faithful
friends, the smith and his wife, adieu, Rosaline
set out with her escort, Babet and the dog.
Nothing had occurred to alarm them or to indicate
that their hiding-place was suspected, and
the blacksmith’s boy, employed for scout duties,
brought in the report that St. Cyr had been
deserted since the previous day, when Rosaline
had left it. The two women entered the place,
therefore, with lighter hearts. Babet was determined
to enter the château, if possible, to secure
Madame de St. Cyr’s jewels and a considerable
sum of money that had been secreted to provide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
for just such an emergency; for they had for
many years expected to be denounced as
Huguenots. Rosaline was to remain near the
hedge that surrounded the garden, to warn
Babet if any one approached, while the older
and stronger woman went for madame’s iron
box. Rosaline doubted the wisdom of the
attempt, yet neither of the two women cared
to face the wilderness without money to pay for
either shelter or food, and it was impossible to
open the secret place where the box was while
the dragoons lurked about the house.</p>

<p>They approached the château with great
caution, listening and watching, but no one appeared,
not a leaf stirred, and Rosaline’s doves
were cooing in the sun.</p>

<p>“Ah, my poor birds,” she said sadly. “I am
glad that the blacksmith’s good wife will take
them; otherwise I should feel as if I were leaving
them to perish.”</p>

<p>Babet did not pause to listen to these sentiments.
Being sure that no one was about, she
entered the garden, followed by Truffe, who
dashed eagerly along, anxious to be at home
again. Still there were no sounds or signs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
humanity, and advancing with a firmer step,
Babet entered the house unmolested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rosaline, left alone outside of the
hedge, walked to and fro in the shade of the mulberries,
watching the place and beginning to feel
easier when she heard no sound, for she knew
that Truffe’s bark would have announced the
presence of strangers. It would take Babet
some little time, and Rosaline walked further on
among the trees; this might be the last time
that she would ever approach the home of
her childhood, and her heart was very sad.
Thoughts of her grandmother thronged into her
mind, and she lived over again the agony of
yesterday. Absorbed in her painful revery, she
forgot her surroundings, and unconsciously
strayed farther into the wood. Here it was
thickest; the tree trunks clustered closely and
the shadows lay about her; beyond, a broad
band of sunlight fell athwart the green shade.
The moss under her feet was thick and brown,
and already the leaves were falling.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one sprang upon her from
behind, strong fingers clasping her throat and
choking back the cries that rose to her lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
She resisted with all her might, but her unseen
foe was stronger than she, and forced her forward.
In vain she strove to call for help, to
evade the clutching arms; then her foot caught
in the gnarled root of a mulberry tree and she
fell, face downward, with those terrible hands
still at her throat. Then the shock of the fall,
the horror of her situation, and a choking sensation
overcame her and she lost consciousness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE OLD WINDMILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Rosaline came to herself it was with
a bewildered recollection of some horrible event,
and, for a few moments, she was scarcely conscious
of her surroundings. Then she opened
her eyes and tried to move, but she could not.
She was in a sitting posture, her hands and
feet tied, and a rope, slipped under her arms,
held her securely against a wall behind her.
The discovery of her situation roused all her
dormant faculties, and she looked about her,
trying to find out where she was. She saw
above her head familiar rafters, and then she
discovered the door closed opposite her, and
recognized the old windmill, near which François
and she had spent those hours of happiness,
so cruelly interrupted. The light in the
place was very dim, and the poor girl could not
at first see plainly in all the corners. She
thought herself alone and wondered where her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
captor was, and what was to come next. Then
the hope that her cries might bring help began
to rise in her heart, and she was on the point
of screaming aloud, when a sound struck her
ear that froze her blood in her veins. It
was a laugh, but it sounded like a fiendish
chuckle. It came from her right hand, and she
turned her head quickly and looked into the
face of Mère Tigrane. An exclamation of
horror and fear burst from Rosaline’s heart,
and she shrieked for help—help!—and the
old fishwife laughed and rocked to and fro.
She was sitting on an old log, in the dim corner,
and she was quite undisturbed by her
prisoner’s cries.</p>

<p>“Shriek away, mademoiselle!” she said
pleasantly. “Ciel! what a voice she has! But
no one will hear you except dear old Mère
Tigrane.”</p>

<p>Rosaline’s heart sank; it might be too true,
for they had arranged to avoid the mill because
strangers sometimes strayed there. She must
have been carried to it, in this fearful woman’s
arms, for it was a considerable distance from
the spot where she had fainted. She sank back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
against the wall with a groan; she knew it was
useless to appeal to this horrible creature; just
such wretched women made a living by informing
against the Huguenots, and there was no
mercy in them. Rosaline did not know what
to do; it was useless to plead with Mère
Tigrane, and it seemed useless, too, to hope
for rescue; moreover, the girl had conceived
such a horror of the old witch, such a scorn of
her vileness, that she could not endure the
sight of her. She closed her eyes and prayed
silently, but she made no sign of begging for
mercy. Her face was like a white rose in the
dim light, and her hair lay in a pale aureole
about her brow; but, with all her agony, she
bore herself proudly.</p>

<p>La Louve sat on her log and watched, gloating
over her and running her red tongue along
the edge of her lips.</p>

<p>“Art comfortable, my lady-bird?” she asked
amiably. “What! so proud that you will not
speak to poor Mère Tigrane? And what do
you suppose I intend to do with such a fine
lady, eh?”</p>

<p>Rosaline opened her eyes and looked at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
with an effort, her soul filled with loathing, and
the old hag saw it in her face and hated her
for it.</p>

<p>“God knows what you want of me,” Rosaline
said. “I have never harmed you, and I cannot
tell why you so misuse me.”</p>

<p>“You never harmed me!” la Louve cried,
throwing up her bony hands. “<i>Dame!</i> you
are a peril to my soul, you little heretic!”</p>

<p>Rosaline read the evil look in the hag’s eyes
and knew that she would never relent; and so
great was her own abhorrence that it was well-nigh
impossible to look at her again. She
turned her eyes toward the door, therefore, and
closed her lips; she had no hope save in
heaven.</p>

<p>“How would mademoiselle like the Tour de
Constance?” Mère Tigrane inquired pleasantly.
“’Tis a healthful place and full of her friends.
<i>Dame de Dieu</i>, what an opportunity to travel
without pay from Nîmes to Aiguemortes!”</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at the girl eagerly,
trying to discover what emotions were stirring
in the heart of her victim, longing for tears and
entreaties; but Rosaline sat like a statue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“<i>Nom de St. Denis!</i>” she exclaimed at last,
“how proud mademoiselle is,—an aristocrat!
But ’tis not the Tour de Constance, <i>ma chérie</i>,”
she added, with a mocking laugh. “No, no,
there must be a better fate for such a lovely
prisoner. <i>Dame!</i> but your flesh is white—I
could eat it. How much does mademoiselle
think that M. de Baudri would pay for such
a prize?”</p>

<p>“<i>Dieu!</i>” cried Rosaline, shaken out of her
resolve, “are you a woman? Is it possible
that the <i>bon Dieu</i> put such a heart in a
woman?”</p>

<p>“A woman, my pretty?” retorted the hag,
with a peal of wild laughter. “Ay—and once
a pretty one! Now you see what I am—and
you are like to live to be like me, unless I wring
that pretty, white throat now! I am a woman,
<i>morbleu</i>, yes—this is what a woman becomes!”
and she crooked her talon fingers pointing at
herself. “Do you think I will pity you?
<i>Dame</i>, I would see you burn this minute with
joy, you little white fool!”</p>

<p>Rosaline nerved herself to bear it without
tears; she struggled hard to ward off the faintness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
that stole upon her, clasping her heart in
a vice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean to do with me?” she
asked, in a strange voice, her eyes chained
now by a horrible fascination to the old hag’s
face.</p>

<p>“Sell you, my sweetheart,” Mère Tigrane
retorted, showing her fangs, “to the highest
bidder in Nîmes. <i>Dame</i>, you are pretty enough
to keep poor Mère Tigrane’s pot boiling for a
year or two, my sweetie.”</p>

<p>“God will not let you do it!” cried Rosaline,
with white lips; “I am His.”</p>

<p>La Louve shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p>“You heretic!” she said gleefully, “you are
the devil’s—body and soul—my fine lady, and
you will wish yourself in hell presently, I
doubt not, <i>ma chérie</i>! Next time you drive
Mère Tigrane away with her fish, I think you
will not hold that little head so high.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried Rosaline, in amazement,
“is it possible that my one little act has made
you hate me so?”</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane shook her head, wagging it
slowly from side to side. “No,” she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
“I hate you for living; I hate all men and all
women and all children. I would blast them if
I could; I live on hatred! <i>Mère de Dieu!</i> how
I love to see a heretic burn!”</p>

<p>Rosaline closed her eyes with a shudder, and
la Louve sat looking at her thoughtfully, with a
greedy eye. <i>Dame!</i> but she would make
money out of this dainty morsel. She had an
eye for beauty, and she knew its market value.
She was even content to let her victim rest a
little, while she turned over in her own mind
many business matters. She could not get the
girl back to Nîmes before night, for she had no
intention of having her prize snatched from her
by any adventurer upon the road. She was
not without uneasiness too, for M. de Baudri
might yet come to St. Cyr, and, if he did, his
search would be thorough and she was likely
to lose her pay. Yet her scheme had worked so
far like a charm. She had seen Babet and
Rosaline leave Nîmes; their disguise had not
deceived her ferret eyes, and she had tracked
them to St. Césaire and from St. Césaire to the
château, for she possessed the patient watchfulness
of a fiend. Her success had surpassed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
most sanguine hopes, and she gloated over it
with savage delight. She knew that she was
strong enough to deal with Babet, and for the
present she looked for no other interference.</p>

<p>The silence that had fallen upon the little mill
was almost more oppressive to Rosaline than
the hag’s dreadful talk; the girl felt as if she
could not endure it longer, her heart throbbed
heavily, there was a choking sensation in her
throat and it seemed as if she could not draw
another breath. And then she struggled in
her bonds and shrieked aloud, for she heard
Truffe’s short bark. Her scream was answered
just as Mère Tigrane sprang upon her and thrust
a rag into her mouth as a gag. The fishwife
was furious, though she expected no one
but Babet.</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i>” she ejaculated, drawing a knife
from her bosom, “I’ll make short work of the
woman and the cur!”</p>

<p>The mill door had stood open too long on
rusty hinges to be easily secured, and she had
only been able to lay an old timber across it.
She took her position therefore, ready to strike,
just as the door was shaken from without and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
pushed heavily inward. It resisted the first
attempt, and she burst out into shrill laughter;
but a second push sent the timber rolling back
a foot, and the third opened the door wide
enough to admit—not Babet, but the cobbler.</p>

<p>Mère Tigrane, taken by surprise, withheld her
knife, but when Babet followed him she struck a
vicious blow at le Bossu.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” she shrieked. “<i>Petit Bossu!</i>
take yourself off—this is my game!”</p>

<p>Charlot quietly thrust his hand into his breast
and drew out a pistol, levelling it at the hag’s
head.</p>

<p>“If you move one finger,” he said grimly,
“you are dead. Babet, take her knife and loose
mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>But Babet would not touch her. She made a
wide circle to avoid any contact, and drawing a
knife from her own wallet, began to cut the
bands about Rosaline’s feet and hands, all the
while pouring out a torrent of sympathy and
self-reproach. Why had she left her lamb to
fall among wolves?</p>

<p>Rosaline was too faint for any words except
a murmur of thanksgiving, and the air was filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
with Mère Tigrane’s oaths as she writhed helpless
before le Bossu’s pistol. He was watching
Babet.</p>

<p>“Do not cut the long rope,” he said grimly;
“untie it—we have need of it.”</p>

<p>At this, la Louve began to howl, rocking to
and fro.</p>

<p>“You villain!” she whined, “you dare not
hang me! M. de Baudri is coming; you will
be punished—” She went on with a stream
of oaths.</p>

<p>Le Bossu stopped her. “Another word,” he
said, “and I’ll shoot you. You will not be
hung, though you deserve it. Babet, stuff
those dirty rags in her mouth, we have heard
enough.”</p>

<p>Babet obeyed this time, first relieving the hag
of her knife and binding her hands.</p>

<p>“There’s some dinner for you to chew, my
beauty,” Babet said pleasantly, and proceeded
to tie her feet.</p>

<p>“Now the rope,” ordered the cobbler; “slip
it twice around her waist—that is it; draw
her back to the post and tie it securely.”</p>

<p>He helped Babet in this, putting the pistol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
back into his bosom. Mère Tigrane was black
in the face with rage, but she could offer no
resistance; only, her terrible eyes leered at
them—red as blood.</p>

<p>Rosaline had gone out and was leaning
against a tree, her face colorless and her hands
clasped. When the others joined her, she
turned and threw her arms about Babet and
burst into tears, too overcome to speak. The
woman tried to comfort and soothe her.</p>

<p>“’Twas Truffe who found you,” she said,
“bless the creature! The cobbler and I would
have been searching still, but suddenly she put
her nose to the ground and came straight as
an arrow!”</p>

<p>Le Bossu was not listening to them; he had
walked a few yards into the wood and knelt
down, bending his head close to the ground.
When he arose his face was white and he
moved quickly toward them.</p>

<p>“Have courage, mademoiselle,” he said
quietly, “but let us be gone, there are horsemen
in the road by St. Cyr; the dragoons have
returned.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE COBBLER’S BARGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two women and le Bossu had followed
the course of the stream, walking rapidly along
the bank, and now they descended the rocky
path by the cataract. They were travelling
west and the afternoon sun shone full in their
faces; the wind was blowing too,—a chill
November wind that swept the leaves from the
chestnut trees and dropped the empty burrs.
They had not wasted breath in words, and now
le Bossu left them and ran forward, looking
under the lowest branches; then he whistled
softly. There was a response, and Babet and
Rosaline stopped in alarm; they expected no
one. The next moment, however, a tall figure
came rapidly towards them and Rosaline recognized
her lover. She gave a little sob of joy
and ran to meet him, the dog bounding beside
her. They met a few yards in front of the
others and he caught her in his arms, supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
her trembling form. Le Bossu looked but
once; in their joy they had forgotten him. He
turned his back and approached Babet, putting
a small but heavy bag in her hands.</p>

<p>“That is mademoiselle’s,” he said calmly;
“guard it well. And now—go on in God’s
name! Do not let them tarry, for Death is
behind them.”</p>

<p>Babet had learned to value the poor little
hunchback, but she was sober and undemonstrative.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>He pointed to the woods. “Back,” he said,
“to keep them from finding Mère Tigrane who
would set them on your track. I will delay
them all I can.”</p>

<p>“It is well,” Babet remarked, “you are a
good man, Charlot; the <i>bon Dieu</i> will bless you.
I suppose you do not want the blessing of a
heretic?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Do not tarry,” he said, warningly.
“Keep straight to the west; M.
d’Aguesseau will guide you. Adieu!”</p>

<p>He looked once more toward the lovers, but
they were still absorbed in each other. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
cobbler turned sadly away, and climbing the
steep path was lost to sight among the trees
before Rosaline knew that he had gone; and
he never heard her thanks, never knew her
remorse because she had, for the moment, forgotten
him in her own joy. There was no
time for her to redeem her error; there was
only time to flee on and on, with a terrible
danger pursuing them and lurking for them at
every step.</p>

<p>Meanwhile le Bossu went back through the
woods. His heart was full, but he was not
without a feeling of joy. So far she was safe,
and he had just given Babet all his savings.
His years of patient labor had not been in vain
if his money could help Rosaline now. He
would have liked to speak to her, to touch
her hand; but what was he? <i>Le Bossu, le
savetier</i>, the beggarly cripple of St. Antoine!
It was enough, and more than enough, to serve
her. <i>Dieu!</i> would his wretched lameness keep
him from reaching the windmill before the
dragoons? He walked fast, urging his energies
to the utmost, but the way seemed long indeed.
A picture of her in her lover’s arms, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
sunshine on her hair, rose before his eyes and
he set his teeth. What was it to him? He was
only a hunchbacked cobbler, he could scarcely
be made of the same clay that they were, yet
his starved soul cried out. Now and then he
stooped down and listened, but the place was
silent save for the rustling of the wind amid the
dead leaves; winter was coming.</p>

<p>At last, the mill! He did not pause after
assuring himself that la Louve was still secure;
he fastened the door as tightly as he could and
sped on toward the château. Fortune smiled
upon him; he was just in time. Not twenty
yards away he came upon M. de Baudri and
a couple of dragoons. The hunchback was
halted by a sharp challenge, but the soldiers
looked indifferent when they recognized him.
Their commander was in a black temper, and
he ordered the cobbler to approach.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Petit Bossu?”
he demanded fiercely. “Out with all you
know, or—” He drew his hand expressively
across his throat.</p>

<p>Charlot assumed an attitude of profound
respect, his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“I am monsieur’s humblest servant,” he said.
“I have been over yonder to sell my shoes in
St. Césaire, and I came here to look about—monsieur
understands, the place is open, the
house of heretics; the poor cobbler thought to
find some trifle left by the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“It would be a devilish small thing if they
left it!” retorted M. de Baudri, with a grim
smile. “Look, you little beast, no trifling—these
heretics have escaped. Have you seen
them?”</p>

<p>The cobbler assumed an air of importance.</p>

<p>“My life is valuable to me, monsieur,” he
said, “and if I tell, the Camisards may kill me, as
they kill the curés; nevertheless, for the sake of
my soul— Monsieur, will the Intendant pay?”</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i>” shouted de Baudri; “pay! I
can pay if I choose, but I’ll shoot you if you
trifle.”</p>

<p>“I will guide you, monsieur,” the cobbler
replied, with a stubborn air, “but I will have
pay for the risk,—a hundred crowns.”</p>

<p>De Baudri burst out with a volley of oaths,
but he flung some money at the hunchback.</p>

<p>“There is some, beast,” he said coarsely;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
“and you shall have the rest if you find the
girl,—Rosaline de St Cyr.”</p>

<p>The cobbler gathered up the money and
counted it with greedy fingers, M. de Baudri
watching him with scornful eyes.</p>

<p>“You promise the rest, monsieur?” le Bossu
persisted, with a shrewd look.</p>

<p>“<i>Dame!</i>” retorted the other; “you’ll get it
and hell too, if you don’t make haste. Where
are these women?”</p>

<p>The hunchback drew closer to him, lowering
his voice and speaking with his hand before his
mouth.</p>

<p>“You shall have them all, monsieur,” he said,
“the girl, the old woman, M. d’Aguesseau, and
the dog!”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien!</i>” exclaimed de Baudri cheerfully;
“you shall have your hundred crowns. <i>Viens
donc</i>, show me the way!”</p>

<p>The hunchback pointed toward the north.</p>

<p>“Up yonder,” he said, “behind those rocks
on the hill, there is a grotto—I know it by
accident; there they have hidden since morning.
The way is long and rocky; monsieur
must follow me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Will they not see us approaching in time to
fly?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Le Bossu shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he replied quietly, “we must go as if
we intended to take the St. Hippolyte road;
then, when we approach the spot we can surround
them. The country is open and bare
below the cave, though it lies in a little wood.
They could not escape us.”</p>

<p>“Go on, then,” said de Baudri, impatiently;
“to the cave or <i>au diable</i>! I tell thee plainly,
though, that deceit will cost thee thy life.”</p>

<p>“So be it, monsieur,” rejoined the hunchback,
calmly; “and the <i>bon Dieu</i> judge between
me and thee,” he added to himself.</p>

<p>A few sharp orders were given, the bugle was
sounded, and the troopers gathered in the road,
each man at his horse’s head. M. de Baudri
came out of the garden and leaped into the
saddle; then his eyes lighted on the cobbler
standing quietly in the road.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said sharply, “Petit Bossu must
be mounted; bring up a horse.”</p>

<p>“I cannot ride,” said the cobbler, meekly; “my
back and my hips, monsieur, will not permit it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“<i>Mille tonnerres!</i>” ejaculated the officer, with
a black frown, “you mean to walk? We shall
not be there for an hour!”</p>

<p>“I can walk fast, at times, monsieur,” replied
Charlot; “I will do my best. If you had but a
cart—”</p>

<p>M. de Baudri cursed him and his deformity.</p>

<p>“A cart!” he said mockingly; “a litter! Do
you suppose that dragoons drive out in carriages;
such vermin should not cumber the
earth. If we miss them, <i>Mère de Dieu</i>, I’ll hang
you!”</p>

<p>“We cannot miss them, monsieur,” rejoined
the cobbler, patiently; “they dare not leave their
lurking place in daylight, and it is yet an hour
to sunset.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dame de Dieu</i>, let us be off!” exclaimed
de Baudri, and gave the order to mount.</p>

<p>The long line of dragoons swung into their
saddles and the little cavalcade moved slowly off,
with le Bossu in advance.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking over the valley of the
Vaunage, and its rays shone on the towers and
spires of Nîmes and sparkled on the polished
steel of the soldiers’ accoutrements. The hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
were purple against the November sky, and
clouds drifted overhead. Autumn had stripped
the landscape of much of its beauty, and the
arid plains about them showed but little verdure
save a low growth of juniper bushes. It was
not a spot to afford many places of concealment,
and as the little troop advanced, M. de
Baudri’s keen eyes swept the scene with the
savage glance of a vulture seeking its prey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>“O DEATH, WHERE IS THY STING?”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later the dusty little cavalcade filed
slowly up a steep and rocky hill and drew rein
beside a strip of woodland on the summit. On
every side the country rolled away, barren and
broken with crags; here and there a low growth
of juniper bushes or a solitary fig tree, where
the soil was more fertile. The dragoons dismounted
at M. de Baudri’s command and surrounded
the spot. It would be impossible for
any one to escape down that bare hillside unseen.
De Baudri’s eyes burned fiercely; he
thought his prey within his grasp. Le Bossu
was lame from the long and weary walk, and his
drawn face was white, but his expression was
full of content.</p>

<p>“A whole hour,” he said to himself. “Please
God she is out of reach!”</p>

<p>He obeyed a motion of M. de Baudri’s hand
and led the way into the wood. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
thick and there was but little underbrush, for
even here the ground was rocky and uncharitable.
He looked about as he walked, as if he
wanted to remember even little things now;
almost all the trees were chestnuts, these and
mulberries growing best in the neighborhood of
Nîmes. He noticed the moss and the lichens,
and here and there a wild vine trailed across the
way. The wind blew keenly now from the
north, and overhead the gray clouds hung low,
but the west was glorious, the sun hanging just
above the horizon. The hunchback noted all
these things, and he heard the heavy tread of
the men behind him, the rattle of M. de Baudri’s
sword. He walked on; a great peace was filling
his soul, his pulses throbbed evenly, he lifted his
head; his life was, after all, worth much,—it was
to pay her ransom. He came to the centre of
the wood and sat down on a large rock; before
him the trees parted and he could look straight
toward the west, the whole landscape at his feet.
He drew M. de Baudri’s money from his wallet
and cast it on the ground.</p>

<p>A suspicion had been dawning upon de Baudri
since they had dismounted, and he halted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
now and stared fiercely from the cobbler to the
despised coins, the price of blood.</p>

<p>“<i>Sang de Dieu!</i>” he thundered, “where is
the grotto, slave?”</p>

<p>Le Bossu turned on him a calm face.</p>

<p>“There is none, monsieur,” he replied simply.</p>

<p>De Baudri broke out with a terrible oath,
drawing his sword.</p>

<p>“You lying, humped toad!” he said, “how
dared you do this?”</p>

<p>He made a move as if to strike him dead, and
then a sudden thought checked him.</p>

<p>“Bah!” he ejaculated, “soil my sword with
the blood of such vermin? I am a fool. Where
is the girl?” he added fiercely. “<i>Pardieu</i>, I
will wring your neck!”</p>

<p>“I do not know where she is,” replied le
Bossu, truthfully enough, for he did not know
where they were then.</p>

<p>“And you led us here to cheat us, slave?”
said de Baudri. “A fine scheme—as you will
learn to your cost. If I thought you knew
where she was, I’d torture it out of you with
hot irons.”</p>

<p>The cobbler did not look at him; his brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
eyes dwelt on the distance, and his soul was
uplifted by the approaching joy of self-sacrifice.
He did not hear the abuse that M. de Baudri
continued to pour upon him; his life was passing
before his eyes, his wretched, abused childhood,
his sharp mortification over his physical
infirmity, his silent, intense longing for friendship
and love, his despised solitude, his hard,
thankless labor; and now it was over, and not
in vain! “Mother of God,” he prayed, “comfort
the wretched.” He awoke to hear M. de Baudri
ordering his soldiers to bring a rope.</p>

<p>A dragoon went for a piece that was coiled
on the back of one of the horses. The troopers
never hunted heretics without rope. He returned
promptly, and approaching le Bossu was
slipping the noose over his head, but another
scheme had occurred to the leader.</p>

<p>“Hang him by the feet,” he said coolly,
pointing with his white hand to a tree. “<i>Sacrebleu!</i>
’twill hurt more so.”</p>

<p>They secured the rope about the hunchback’s
feet while their victim watched them with calm
eyes.</p>

<p>“What matter,” he thought, “if I have saved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
her? May the <i>bon Dieu</i> make my sacrifice
complete!”</p>

<p>De Baudri watched him coolly, wondering
that the rapt face was so calm.</p>

<p>“When I give the order,” he said to the
soldiers, “haul him up and let him hang twenty
minutes. Now, rogue, where is the girl?”</p>

<p>No answer; the clear eyes looked straight
toward the setting sun, over the beautiful valley
of the Vaunage. The radiance of the west fell
on his face, as though he looked through those
golden gates into Paradise.</p>

<p>“<i>Nom de St. Denis!</i>” ejaculated de Baudri,
“what a stubborn fool. Now, my men!”</p>

<p>He raised his hand carelessly and the cripple
was drawn up by the feet to the limb of a tree,
his head hanging with the face to the west.
Ten minutes passed—twenty.</p>

<p>“Fire!” said M. de Baudri.</p>

<p>There was the crash of a volley, the blue
smoke rose, the poor, misshapen body swung
around in the red sunlight, and there was
silence,—broken at last by the trample of
horses as the troopers mounted and rode down
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>The sun set in a sea of gold; the gray clouds
above turned the color of a red rose; a haze
floated over Nîmes. In the wood, only the
dead leaves rustled as they fell. In the upper
room of the shop of Two Shoes, the candle
before the shrine had burned down to the very
end. It flickered and flared up, a single flame
in the gloom, and then it went out forever.</p>

<small>THE SHIP AT SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> weeks later a party of wayfarers came
to the old mill at St. Cyr. The door was
fastened, but they opened it, only to recoil with
horror. They found a hideous old woman tied
there. She had been dead a long while and
the fearful distortion of her face sent them
shrieking from the spot. Even in death Mère
Tigrane had not lost her power to strike terror
to the hearts of others.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a ship was crossing the
channel to Dover, on a calm sea with a blue
sky overhead. The white foam gathered in its
wake and the sun glistened on its full-set sails
and on the flag bearing the crosses of St.
George and St. Andrew. On the deck stood
Rosaline and her lover,—her husband now,
for they had been wedded in the Cévennes,—and
near them sat Babet contentedly feeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Truffe with a cake. Rosaline leaned on the
rail, looking back toward France.</p>

<p>“Dear native land,” she sighed softly, “I
may never see you more; yet I am content.
Ah, François, we ought to be thankful
indeed. I am glad that Cavalier sent you to
England; I can bear no more, and it may
be we can move these strangers to help the
cause.”</p>

<p>“I pray so,” he replied gently; “England’s
queen is favorable to us. At least, you will be
safe; I could not take my wife to those rugged
hiding-places in the Cévennes, with winter so
near. Ah, my love, are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>She looked up with tender eyes. “I am
content, my husband,” she answered softly.
“I bless the <i>bon Dieu</i>, but my heart is sore at
the thought of poor Charlot. Can it be that
the blacksmith’s boy was mistaken? Could
they really hang him for not betraying us?”</p>

<p>“I fear so,” replied d’Aguesseau sadly;
“the report came straight enough. Let us
remember, though, that it ended his sufferings;
he told me that his life was full of
pain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>Rosaline looked back over the blue sea with
tearful eyes.</p>

<p>“Poor little Charlot,” she murmured gently.
“The hunchbacked cobbler with the soul of a
hero and a martyr. His memory shall be
sacred to me forever.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The hero of “The Cardinal’s Musketeer” is a knightly
youth, brave and generous, and a devoted lover. The plots
of the King’s mother, Marie de Médicis, and the counter-plots
of the patriotic Cardinal give rise to forceful action
and dramatic situations; yet no attempt is made to cram
the reader’s mind with the facts and dates of French history.
* * * Our hearty sympathy is engaged from the first on
behalf of Péron, the Cardinal’s Musketeer, to whom we are
introduced in his childhood, and on behalf of the haughty
little demoiselle Renée, who ultimately becomes his wife.
The story is full of life and love. Lengthy descriptions
and sermonizings are conspicuously absent; the characters
speak for themselves, act their parts, and manifest all that
is in them by their words and deeds.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“The story is full of life, love, and exquisite, not to say dramatic, incidents.”—<i>Boston
Times.</i></p>

<p>“There is love enough to warm and color the adventure, but not to cloy the
taste; there is dramatic contrast of character and situation, swiftness of movement,
and an easy, confident flow of style that combine to make a delightful tale—one
that the reader will lay down with a regret that there is not more of it.”—<i>Chicago
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“The story is a strong, well-studied reproduction of the times of Cardinal
Richelieu. * * * It is a stirring romance, overflowing with life and action.”—<i>The

<p class="ph2">The DREAD AND FEAR<br>
OF KINGS</p>
</div>

<p class="ph1">By J. BRECKENRIDGE ELLIS</p>

<p class="center"><i>12mo . . $1.25</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-cap">READERS will find in this historical romance a work of
thrilling interest. The period is the beginning of the
Christian era, and the scenes are laid in Rome, the island of
Capri and other parts of Italy. The Emperor, Tiberius, had
retired to Capri, and from his mysterious seclusion sent
forth decrees which kept the Imperial City in a continual
state of terror. A single word uttered in disrespect of the
Emperor or his favorite, Sejanus, might mean death and
confiscation of property. No man in Rome felt the least
security that his life might not in a moment be sworn away
by some slave or base informer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is this reign of terror in Rome that forms the background
to the striking picture of ancient life that Mr.
Ellis has produced. The story is one of love and adventure,
in which types of the diverse nationalities that then thronged
the Imperial City are revealed in characters—some of them
historical personages—of marked individuality. The interest
of the love story, the stirring incidents and the spirited
dialogue, enchain the attention of the reader.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Story of Tonty” is eminently a Western story, beginning
at Montreal, tarrying at Fort Frontenac, and ending at the old fort
at Starved Rock, on the Illinois River. It weaves the adventures
of the two great explorers, the intrepid La Salle and his faithful
lieutenant, Tonty, into a tale as thrilling and romantic as the descriptive
portions are brilliant and vivid. It is superbly illustrated
with twenty-three masterly drawings by Mr. Enoch Ward.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Such tales as this render service past expression to the cause of history.
They weave a spell in which old chronicles are vivified and breathe
out human life. Mrs. Catherwood, in thus bringing out from the treasure-houses
of half-forgotten historical record things new and old, has set herself
one of the worthiest literary tasks of her generation, and is showing
herself finely adequate to its fulfillment.—<i>Transcript, Boston.</i></p>

<p>A powerful story by a writer newly sprung to fame.... All the
century we have been waiting for the deft hand that could put flesh upon
the dry bones of our heroes. Here is a recreation indeed.... One
comes from the reading of the romance with a quickened interest in our
early national history, and a profound admiration for the art that can so
transport us to the dreamful realms where fancy is monarch of fact.—<i>Press,
Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p>“The Story of Tonty” is full of the atmosphere of its time. It
betrays an intimate and sympathetic knowledge of the great age of explorers,
and it is altogether a charming piece of work.—<i>Christian
Union, New York.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
